    <h2>
      CHAPTER I
    </h2>
    <p>
      About thirty years ago Miss Maria Ward, of Huntingdon, with only seven
      thousand pounds, had the good luck to captivate Sir Thomas Bertram, of
      Mansfield Park, in the county of Northampton, and to be thereby raised to
      the rank of a baronet&rsquo;s lady, with all the comforts and consequences of an
      handsome house and large income. All Huntingdon exclaimed on the greatness
      of the match, and her uncle, the lawyer, himself, allowed her to be at
      least three thousand pounds short of any equitable claim to it. She had
      two sisters to be benefited by her elevation; and such of their
      acquaintance as thought Miss Ward and Miss Frances quite as handsome as
      Miss Maria, did not scruple to predict their marrying with almost equal
      advantage. But there certainly are not so many men of large fortune in the
      world as there are pretty women to deserve them. Miss Ward, at the end of
      half a dozen years, found herself obliged to be attached to the Rev. Mr.
      Norris, a friend of her brother-in-law, with scarcely any private fortune,
      and Miss Frances fared yet worse. Miss Ward&rsquo;s match, indeed, when it came
      to the point, was not contemptible: Sir Thomas being happily able to give
      his friend an income in the living of Mansfield; and Mr. and Mrs. Norris
      began their career of conjugal felicity with very little less than a
      thousand a year. But Miss Frances married, in the common phrase, to
      disoblige her family, and by fixing on a lieutenant of marines, without
      education, fortune, or connexions, did it very thoroughly. She could
      hardly have made a more untoward choice. Sir Thomas Bertram had interest,
      which, from principle as well as pride&mdash;from a general wish of doing
      right, and a desire of seeing all that were connected with him in
      situations of respectability, he would have been glad to exert for the
      advantage of Lady Bertram&rsquo;s sister; but her husband&rsquo;s profession was such
      as no interest could reach; and before he had time to devise any other
      method of assisting them, an absolute breach between the sisters had taken
      place. It was the natural result of the conduct of each party, and such as
      a very imprudent marriage almost always produces. To save herself from
      useless remonstrance, Mrs. Price never wrote to her family on the subject
      till actually married. Lady Bertram, who was a woman of very tranquil
      feelings, and a temper remarkably easy and indolent, would have contented
      herself with merely giving up her sister, and thinking no more of the
      matter; but Mrs. Norris had a spirit of activity, which could not be
      satisfied till she had written a long and angry letter to Fanny, to point
      out the folly of her conduct, and threaten her with all its possible ill
      consequences. Mrs. Price, in her turn, was injured and angry; and an
      answer, which comprehended each sister in its bitterness, and bestowed
      such very disrespectful reflections on the pride of Sir Thomas as Mrs.
      Norris could not possibly keep to herself, put an end to all intercourse
      between them for a considerable period.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their homes were so distant, and the circles in which they moved so
      distinct, as almost to preclude the means of ever hearing of each other&rsquo;s
      existence during the eleven following years, or, at least, to make it very
      wonderful to Sir Thomas that Mrs. Norris should ever have it in her power
      to tell them, as she now and then did, in an angry voice, that Fanny had
      got another child. By the end of eleven years, however, Mrs. Price could
      no longer afford to cherish pride or resentment, or to lose one connexion
      that might possibly assist her. A large and still increasing family, an
      husband disabled for active service, but not the less equal to company and
      good liquor, and a very small income to supply their wants, made her eager
      to regain the friends she had so carelessly sacrificed; and she addressed
      Lady Bertram in a letter which spoke so much contrition and despondence,
      such a superfluity of children, and such a want of almost everything else,
      as could not but dispose them all to a reconciliation. She was preparing
      for her ninth lying-in; and after bewailing the circumstance, and
      imploring their countenance as sponsors to the expected child, she could
      not conceal how important she felt they might be to the future maintenance
      of the eight already in being. Her eldest was a boy of ten years old, a
      fine spirited fellow, who longed to be out in the world; but what could
      she do? Was there any chance of his being hereafter useful to Sir Thomas
      in the concerns of his West Indian property? No situation would be beneath
      him; or what did Sir Thomas think of Woolwich? or how could a boy be sent
      out to the East?
    </p>
    <p>
      The letter was not unproductive. It re-established peace and kindness. Sir
      Thomas sent friendly advice and professions, Lady Bertram dispatched money
      and baby-linen, and Mrs. Norris wrote the letters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such were its immediate effects, and within a twelvemonth a more important
      advantage to Mrs. Price resulted from it. Mrs. Norris was often observing
      to the others that she could not get her poor sister and her family out of
      her head, and that, much as they had all done for her, she seemed to be
      wanting to do more; and at length she could not but own it to be her wish
      that poor Mrs. Price should be relieved from the charge and expense of one
      child entirely out of her great number. &ldquo;What if they were among them to
      undertake the care of her eldest daughter, a girl now nine years old, of
      an age to require more attention than her poor mother could possibly give?
      The trouble and expense of it to them would be nothing, compared with the
      benevolence of the action.&rdquo; Lady Bertram agreed with her instantly. &ldquo;I
      think we cannot do better,&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;let us send for the child.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sir Thomas could not give so instantaneous and unqualified a consent. He
      debated and hesitated;&mdash;it was a serious charge;&mdash;a girl so
      brought up must be adequately provided for, or there would be cruelty
      instead of kindness in taking her from her family. He thought of his own
      four children, of his two sons, of cousins in love, etc.;&mdash;but no
      sooner had he deliberately begun to state his objections, than Mrs. Norris
      interrupted him with a reply to them all, whether stated or not.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Sir Thomas, I perfectly comprehend you, and do justice to the
      generosity and delicacy of your notions, which indeed are quite of a piece
      with your general conduct; and I entirely agree with you in the main as to
      the propriety of doing everything one could by way of providing for a
      child one had in a manner taken into one&rsquo;s own hands; and I am sure I
      should be the last person in the world to withhold my mite upon such an
      occasion. Having no children of my own, who should I look to in any little
      matter I may ever have to bestow, but the children of my sisters?&mdash;and
      I am sure Mr. Norris is too just&mdash;but you know I am a woman of few
      words and professions. Do not let us be frightened from a good deed by a
      trifle. Give a girl an education, and introduce her properly into the
      world, and ten to one but she has the means of settling well, without
      farther expense to anybody. A niece of ours, Sir Thomas, I may say, or at
      least of <i>yours</i>, would not grow up in this neighbourhood without
      many advantages. I don&rsquo;t say she would be so handsome as her cousins. I
      dare say she would not; but she would be introduced into the society of
      this country under such very favourable circumstances as, in all human
      probability, would get her a creditable establishment. You are thinking of
      your sons&mdash;but do not you know that, of all things upon earth, <i>that</i>
      is the least likely to happen, brought up as they would be, always
      together like brothers and sisters? It is morally impossible. I never knew
      an instance of it. It is, in fact, the only sure way of providing against
      the connexion. Suppose her a pretty girl, and seen by Tom or Edmund for
      the first time seven years hence, and I dare say there would be mischief.
      The very idea of her having been suffered to grow up at a distance from us
      all in poverty and neglect, would be enough to make either of the dear,
      sweet-tempered boys in love with her. But breed her up with them from this
      time, and suppose her even to have the beauty of an angel, and she will
      never be more to either than a sister.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is a great deal of truth in what you say,&rdquo; replied Sir Thomas, &ldquo;and
      far be it from me to throw any fanciful impediment in the way of a plan
      which would be so consistent with the relative situations of each. I only
      meant to observe that it ought not to be lightly engaged in, and that to
      make it really serviceable to Mrs. Price, and creditable to ourselves, we
      must secure to the child, or consider ourselves engaged to secure to her
      hereafter, as circumstances may arise, the provision of a gentlewoman, if
      no such establishment should offer as you are so sanguine in expecting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thoroughly understand you,&rdquo; cried Mrs. Norris, &ldquo;you are everything that
      is generous and considerate, and I am sure we shall never disagree on this
      point. Whatever I can do, as you well know, I am always ready enough to do
      for the good of those I love; and, though I could never feel for this
      little girl the hundredth part of the regard I bear your own dear
      children, nor consider her, in any respect, so much my own, I should hate
      myself if I were capable of neglecting her. Is not she a sister&rsquo;s child?
      and could I bear to see her want while I had a bit of bread to give her?
      My dear Sir Thomas, with all my faults I have a warm heart; and, poor as I
      am, would rather deny myself the necessaries of life than do an ungenerous
      thing. So, if you are not against it, I will write to my poor sister
      tomorrow, and make the proposal; and, as soon as matters are settled, <i>I</i>
      will engage to get the child to Mansfield; <i>you</i> shall have no
      trouble about it. My own trouble, you know, I never regard. I will send
      Nanny to London on purpose, and she may have a bed at her cousin the
      saddler&rsquo;s, and the child be appointed to meet her there. They may easily
      get her from Portsmouth to town by the coach, under the care of any
      creditable person that may chance to be going. I dare say there is always
      some reputable tradesman&rsquo;s wife or other going up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Except to the attack on Nanny&rsquo;s cousin, Sir Thomas no longer made any
      objection, and a more respectable, though less economical rendezvous being
      accordingly substituted, everything was considered as settled, and the
      pleasures of so benevolent a scheme were already enjoyed. The division of
      gratifying sensations ought not, in strict justice, to have been equal;
      for Sir Thomas was fully resolved to be the real and consistent patron of
      the selected child, and Mrs. Norris had not the least intention of being
      at any expense whatever in her maintenance. As far as walking, talking,
      and contriving reached, she was thoroughly benevolent, and nobody knew
      better how to dictate liberality to others; but her love of money was
      equal to her love of directing, and she knew quite as well how to save her
      own as to spend that of her friends. Having married on a narrower income
      than she had been used to look forward to, she had, from the first,
      fancied a very strict line of economy necessary; and what was begun as a
      matter of prudence, soon grew into a matter of choice, as an object of
      that needful solicitude which there were no children to supply. Had there
      been a family to provide for, Mrs. Norris might never have saved her
      money; but having no care of that kind, there was nothing to impede her
      frugality, or lessen the comfort of making a yearly addition to an income
      which they had never lived up to. Under this infatuating principle,
      counteracted by no real affection for her sister, it was impossible for
      her to aim at more than the credit of projecting and arranging so
      expensive a charity; though perhaps she might so little know herself as to
      walk home to the Parsonage, after this conversation, in the happy belief
      of being the most liberal-minded sister and aunt in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the subject was brought forward again, her views were more fully
      explained; and, in reply to Lady Bertram&rsquo;s calm inquiry of &ldquo;Where shall
      the child come to first, sister, to you or to us?&rdquo; Sir Thomas heard with
      some surprise that it would be totally out of Mrs. Norris&rsquo;s power to take
      any share in the personal charge of her. He had been considering her as a
      particularly welcome addition at the Parsonage, as a desirable companion
      to an aunt who had no children of her own; but he found himself wholly
      mistaken. Mrs. Norris was sorry to say that the little girl&rsquo;s staying with
      them, at least as things then were, was quite out of the question. Poor
      Mr. Norris&rsquo;s indifferent state of health made it an impossibility: he
      could no more bear the noise of a child than he could fly; if, indeed, he
      should ever get well of his gouty complaints, it would be a different
      matter: she should then be glad to take her turn, and think nothing of the
      inconvenience; but just now, poor Mr. Norris took up every moment of her
      time, and the very mention of such a thing she was sure would distract
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then she had better come to us,&rdquo; said Lady Bertram, with the utmost
      composure. After a short pause Sir Thomas added with dignity, &ldquo;Yes, let
      her home be in this house. We will endeavour to do our duty by her, and
      she will, at least, have the advantage of companions of her own age, and
      of a regular instructress.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very true,&rdquo; cried Mrs. Norris, &ldquo;which are both very important
      considerations; and it will be just the same to Miss Lee whether she has
      three girls to teach, or only two&mdash;there can be no difference. I only
      wish I could be more useful; but you see I do all in my power. I am not
      one of those that spare their own trouble; and Nanny shall fetch her,
      however it may put me to inconvenience to have my chief counsellor away
      for three days. I suppose, sister, you will put the child in the little
      white attic, near the old nurseries. It will be much the best place for
      her, so near Miss Lee, and not far from the girls, and close by the
      housemaids, who could either of them help to dress her, you know, and take
      care of her clothes, for I suppose you would not think it fair to expect
      Ellis to wait on her as well as the others. Indeed, I do not see that you
      could possibly place her anywhere else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Bertram made no opposition.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope she will prove a well-disposed girl,&rdquo; continued Mrs. Norris, &ldquo;and
      be sensible of her uncommon good fortune in having such friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Should her disposition be really bad,&rdquo; said Sir Thomas, &ldquo;we must not, for
      our own children&rsquo;s sake, continue her in the family; but there is no
      reason to expect so great an evil. We shall probably see much to wish
      altered in her, and must prepare ourselves for gross ignorance, some
      meanness of opinions, and very distressing vulgarity of manner; but these
      are not incurable faults; nor, I trust, can they be dangerous for her
      associates. Had my daughters been <i>younger</i> than herself, I should
      have considered the introduction of such a companion as a matter of very
      serious moment; but, as it is, I hope there can be nothing to fear for <i>them</i>,
      and everything to hope for <i>her</i>, from the association.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is exactly what I think,&rdquo; cried Mrs. Norris, &ldquo;and what I was saying
      to my husband this morning. It will be an education for the child, said I,
      only being with her cousins; if Miss Lee taught her nothing, she would
      learn to be good and clever from <i>them</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope she will not tease my poor pug,&rdquo; said Lady Bertram; &ldquo;I have but
      just got Julia to leave it alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There will be some difficulty in our way, Mrs. Norris,&rdquo; observed Sir
      Thomas, &ldquo;as to the distinction proper to be made between the girls as they
      grow up: how to preserve in the minds of my <i>daughters</i> the
      consciousness of what they are, without making them think too lowly of
      their cousin; and how, without depressing her spirits too far, to make her
      remember that she is not a <i>Miss Bertram</i>. I should wish to see them
      very good friends, and would, on no account, authorise in my girls the
      smallest degree of arrogance towards their relation; but still they cannot
      be equals. Their rank, fortune, rights, and expectations will always be
      different. It is a point of great delicacy, and you must assist us in our
      endeavours to choose exactly the right line of conduct.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Norris was quite at his service; and though she perfectly agreed with
      him as to its being a most difficult thing, encouraged him to hope that
      between them it would be easily managed.
    </p>
    <p>
      It will be readily believed that Mrs. Norris did not write to her sister
      in vain. Mrs. Price seemed rather surprised that a girl should be fixed
      on, when she had so many fine boys, but accepted the offer most
      thankfully, assuring them of her daughter&rsquo;s being a very well-disposed,
      good-humoured girl, and trusting they would never have cause to throw her
      off. She spoke of her farther as somewhat delicate and puny, but was
      sanguine in the hope of her being materially better for change of air.
      Poor woman! she probably thought change of air might agree with many of
      her children.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II
    </h2>
    <p>
      The little girl performed her long journey in safety; and at Northampton
      was met by Mrs. Norris, who thus regaled in the credit of being foremost
      to welcome her, and in the importance of leading her in to the others, and
      recommending her to their kindness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fanny Price was at this time just ten years old, and though there might
      not be much in her first appearance to captivate, there was, at least,
      nothing to disgust her relations. She was small of her age, with no glow
      of complexion, nor any other striking beauty; exceedingly timid and shy,
      and shrinking from notice; but her air, though awkward, was not vulgar,
      her voice was sweet, and when she spoke her countenance was pretty. Sir
      Thomas and Lady Bertram received her very kindly; and Sir Thomas, seeing
      how much she needed encouragement, tried to be all that was conciliating:
      but he had to work against a most untoward gravity of deportment; and Lady
      Bertram, without taking half so much trouble, or speaking one word where
      he spoke ten, by the mere aid of a good-humoured smile, became immediately
      the less awful character of the two.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young people were all at home, and sustained their share in the
      introduction very well, with much good humour, and no embarrassment, at
      least on the part of the sons, who, at seventeen and sixteen, and tall of
      their age, had all the grandeur of men in the eyes of their little cousin.
      The two girls were more at a loss from being younger and in greater awe of
      their father, who addressed them on the occasion with rather an
      injudicious particularity. But they were too much used to company and
      praise to have anything like natural shyness; and their confidence
      increasing from their cousin&rsquo;s total want of it, they were soon able to
      take a full survey of her face and her frock in easy indifference.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were a remarkably fine family, the sons very well-looking, the
      daughters decidedly handsome, and all of them well-grown and forward of
      their age, which produced as striking a difference between the cousins in
      person, as education had given to their address; and no one would have
      supposed the girls so nearly of an age as they really were. There were in
      fact but two years between the youngest and Fanny. Julia Bertram was only
      twelve, and Maria but a year older. The little visitor meanwhile was as
      unhappy as possible. Afraid of everybody, ashamed of herself, and longing
      for the home she had left, she knew not how to look up, and could scarcely
      speak to be heard, or without crying. Mrs. Norris had been talking to her
      the whole way from Northampton of her wonderful good fortune, and the
      extraordinary degree of gratitude and good behaviour which it ought to
      produce, and her consciousness of misery was therefore increased by the
      idea of its being a wicked thing for her not to be happy. The fatigue,
      too, of so long a journey, became soon no trifling evil. In vain were the
      well-meant condescensions of Sir Thomas, and all the officious
      prognostications of Mrs. Norris that she would be a good girl; in vain did
      Lady Bertram smile and make her sit on the sofa with herself and pug, and
      vain was even the sight of a gooseberry tart towards giving her comfort;
      she could scarcely swallow two mouthfuls before tears interrupted her, and
      sleep seeming to be her likeliest friend, she was taken to finish her
      sorrows in bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is not a very promising beginning,&rdquo; said Mrs. Norris, when Fanny had
      left the room. &ldquo;After all that I said to her as we came along, I thought
      she would have behaved better; I told her how much might depend upon her
      acquitting herself well at first. I wish there may not be a little
      sulkiness of temper&mdash;her poor mother had a good deal; but we must
      make allowances for such a child&mdash;and I do not know that her being
      sorry to leave her home is really against her, for, with all its faults,
      it <i>was</i> her home, and she cannot as yet understand how much she has
      changed for the better; but then there is moderation in all things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It required a longer time, however, than Mrs. Norris was inclined to
      allow, to reconcile Fanny to the novelty of Mansfield Park, and the
      separation from everybody she had been used to. Her feelings were very
      acute, and too little understood to be properly attended to. Nobody meant
      to be unkind, but nobody put themselves out of their way to secure her
      comfort.
    </p>
    <p>
      The holiday allowed to the Miss Bertrams the next day, on purpose to
      afford leisure for getting acquainted with, and entertaining their young
      cousin, produced little union. They could not but hold her cheap on
      finding that she had but two sashes, and had never learned French; and
      when they perceived her to be little struck with the duet they were so
      good as to play, they could do no more than make her a generous present of
      some of their least valued toys, and leave her to herself, while they
      adjourned to whatever might be the favourite holiday sport of the moment,
      making artificial flowers or wasting gold paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fanny, whether near or from her cousins, whether in the schoolroom, the
      drawing-room, or the shrubbery, was equally forlorn, finding something to
      fear in every person and place. She was disheartened by Lady Bertram&rsquo;s
      silence, awed by Sir Thomas&rsquo;s grave looks, and quite overcome by Mrs.
      Norris&rsquo;s admonitions. Her elder cousins mortified her by reflections on
      her size, and abashed her by noticing her shyness: Miss Lee wondered at
      her ignorance, and the maid-servants sneered at her clothes; and when to
      these sorrows was added the idea of the brothers and sisters among whom
      she had always been important as playfellow, instructress, and nurse, the
      despondence that sunk her little heart was severe.
    </p>
    <p>
      The grandeur of the house astonished, but could not console her. The rooms
      were too large for her to move in with ease: whatever she touched she
      expected to injure, and she crept about in constant terror of something or
      other; often retreating towards her own chamber to cry; and the little
      girl who was spoken of in the drawing-room when she left it at night as
      seeming so desirably sensible of her peculiar good fortune, ended every
      day&rsquo;s sorrows by sobbing herself to sleep. A week had passed in this way,
      and no suspicion of it conveyed by her quiet passive manner, when she was
      found one morning by her cousin Edmund, the youngest of the sons, sitting
      crying on the attic stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear little cousin,&rdquo; said he, with all the gentleness of an excellent
      nature, &ldquo;what can be the matter?&rdquo; And sitting down by her, he was at great
      pains to overcome her shame in being so surprised, and persuade her to
      speak openly. Was she ill? or was anybody angry with her? or had she
      quarrelled with Maria and Julia? or was she puzzled about anything in her
      lesson that he could explain? Did she, in short, want anything he could
      possibly get her, or do for her? For a long while no answer could be
      obtained beyond a &ldquo;no, no&mdash;not at all&mdash;no, thank you&rdquo;; but he
      still persevered; and no sooner had he begun to revert to her own home,
      than her increased sobs explained to him where the grievance lay. He tried
      to console her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are sorry to leave Mama, my dear little Fanny,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;which shows
      you to be a very good girl; but you must remember that you are with
      relations and friends, who all love you, and wish to make you happy. Let
      us walk out in the park, and you shall tell me all about your brothers and
      sisters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On pursuing the subject, he found that, dear as all these brothers and
      sisters generally were, there was one among them who ran more in her
      thoughts than the rest. It was William whom she talked of most, and wanted
      most to see. William, the eldest, a year older than herself, her constant
      companion and friend; her advocate with her mother (of whom he was the
      darling) in every distress. &ldquo;William did not like she should come away; he
      had told her he should miss her very much indeed.&rdquo; &ldquo;But William will write
      to you, I dare say.&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, he had promised he would, but he had told <i>her</i>
      to write first.&rdquo; &ldquo;And when shall you do it?&rdquo; She hung her head and
      answered hesitatingly, &ldquo;she did not know; she had not any paper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If that be all your difficulty, I will furnish you with paper and every
      other material, and you may write your letter whenever you choose. Would
      it make you happy to write to William?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, very.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then let it be done now. Come with me into the breakfast-room, we shall
      find everything there, and be sure of having the room to ourselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, cousin, will it go to the post?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, depend upon me it shall: it shall go with the other letters; and, as
      your uncle will frank it, it will cost William nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My uncle!&rdquo; repeated Fanny, with a frightened look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, when you have written the letter, I will take it to my father to
      frank.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fanny thought it a bold measure, but offered no further resistance; and
      they went together into the breakfast-room, where Edmund prepared her
      paper, and ruled her lines with all the goodwill that her brother could
      himself have felt, and probably with somewhat more exactness. He continued
      with her the whole time of her writing, to assist her with his penknife or
      his orthography, as either were wanted; and added to these attentions,
      which she felt very much, a kindness to her brother which delighted her
      beyond all the rest. He wrote with his own hand his love to his cousin
      William, and sent him half a guinea under the seal. Fanny&rsquo;s feelings on
      the occasion were such as she believed herself incapable of expressing;
      but her countenance and a few artless words fully conveyed all their
      gratitude and delight, and her cousin began to find her an interesting
      object. He talked to her more, and, from all that she said, was convinced
      of her having an affectionate heart, and a strong desire of doing right;
      and he could perceive her to be farther entitled to attention by great
      sensibility of her situation, and great timidity. He had never knowingly
      given her pain, but he now felt that she required more positive kindness;
      and with that view endeavoured, in the first place, to lessen her fears of
      them all, and gave her especially a great deal of good advice as to
      playing with Maria and Julia, and being as merry as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      From this day Fanny grew more comfortable. She felt that she had a friend,
      and the kindness of her cousin Edmund gave her better spirits with
      everybody else. The place became less strange, and the people less
      formidable; and if there were some amongst them whom she could not cease
      to fear, she began at least to know their ways, and to catch the best
      manner of conforming to them. The little rusticities and awkwardnesses
      which had at first made grievous inroads on the tranquillity of all, and
      not least of herself, necessarily wore away, and she was no longer
      materially afraid to appear before her uncle, nor did her aunt Norris&rsquo;s
      voice make her start very much. To her cousins she became occasionally an
      acceptable companion. Though unworthy, from inferiority of age and
      strength, to be their constant associate, their pleasures and schemes were
      sometimes of a nature to make a third very useful, especially when that
      third was of an obliging, yielding temper; and they could not but own,
      when their aunt inquired into her faults, or their brother Edmund urged
      her claims to their kindness, that &ldquo;Fanny was good-natured enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Edmund was uniformly kind himself; and she had nothing worse to endure on
      the part of Tom than that sort of merriment which a young man of seventeen
      will always think fair with a child of ten. He was just entering into
      life, full of spirits, and with all the liberal dispositions of an eldest
      son, who feels born only for expense and enjoyment. His kindness to his
      little cousin was consistent with his situation and rights: he made her
      some very pretty presents, and laughed at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      As her appearance and spirits improved, Sir Thomas and Mrs. Norris thought
      with greater satisfaction of their benevolent plan; and it was pretty soon
      decided between them that, though far from clever, she showed a tractable
      disposition, and seemed likely to give them little trouble. A mean opinion
      of her abilities was not confined to <i>them</i>. Fanny could read, work,
      and write, but she had been taught nothing more; and as her cousins found
      her ignorant of many things with which they had been long familiar, they
      thought her prodigiously stupid, and for the first two or three weeks were
      continually bringing some fresh report of it into the drawing-room. &ldquo;Dear
      mama, only think, my cousin cannot put the map of Europe together&mdash;or
      my cousin cannot tell the principal rivers in Russia&mdash;or, she never
      heard of Asia Minor&mdash;or she does not know the difference between
      water-colours and crayons!&mdash;How strange!&mdash;Did you ever hear
      anything so stupid?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; their considerate aunt would reply, &ldquo;it is very bad, but you
      must not expect everybody to be as forward and quick at learning as
      yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, aunt, she is really so very ignorant!&mdash;Do you know, we asked
      her last night which way she would go to get to Ireland; and she said, she
      should cross to the Isle of Wight. She thinks of nothing but the Isle of
      Wight, and she calls it <i>the</i> <i>Island</i>, as if there were no
      other island in the world. I am sure I should have been ashamed of myself,
      if I had not known better long before I was so old as she is. I cannot
      remember the time when I did not know a great deal that she has not the
      least notion of yet. How long ago it is, aunt, since we used to repeat the
      chronological order of the kings of England, with the dates of their
      accession, and most of the principal events of their reigns!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; added the other; &ldquo;and of the Roman emperors as low as Severus;
      besides a great deal of the heathen mythology, and all the metals,
      semi-metals, planets, and distinguished philosophers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very true indeed, my dears, but you are blessed with wonderful memories,
      and your poor cousin has probably none at all. There is a vast deal of
      difference in memories, as well as in everything else, and therefore you
      must make allowance for your cousin, and pity her deficiency. And remember
      that, if you are ever so forward and clever yourselves, you should always
      be modest; for, much as you know already, there is a great deal more for
      you to learn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know there is, till I am seventeen. But I must tell you another
      thing of Fanny, so odd and so stupid. Do you know, she says she does not
      want to learn either music or drawing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be sure, my dear, that is very stupid indeed, and shows a great want
      of genius and emulation. But, all things considered, I do not know whether
      it is not as well that it should be so, for, though you know (owing to me)
      your papa and mama are so good as to bring her up with you, it is not at
      all necessary that she should be as accomplished as you are;&mdash;on the
      contrary, it is much more desirable that there should be a difference.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Such were the counsels by which Mrs. Norris assisted to form her nieces&rsquo; 
      minds; and it is not very wonderful that, with all their promising talents
      and early information, they should be entirely deficient in the less
      common acquirements of self-knowledge, generosity and humility. In
      everything but disposition they were admirably taught. Sir Thomas did not
      know what was wanting, because, though a truly anxious father, he was not
      outwardly affectionate, and the reserve of his manner repressed all the
      flow of their spirits before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the education of her daughters Lady Bertram paid not the smallest
      attention. She had not time for such cares. She was a woman who spent her
      days in sitting, nicely dressed, on a sofa, doing some long piece of
      needlework, of little use and no beauty, thinking more of her pug than her
      children, but very indulgent to the latter when it did not put herself to
      inconvenience, guided in everything important by Sir Thomas, and in
      smaller concerns by her sister. Had she possessed greater leisure for the
      service of her girls, she would probably have supposed it unnecessary, for
      they were under the care of a governess, with proper masters, and could
      want nothing more. As for Fanny&rsquo;s being stupid at learning, &ldquo;she could
      only say it was very unlucky, but some people <i>were</i> stupid, and
      Fanny must take more pains: she did not know what else was to be done;
      and, except her being so dull, she must add she saw no harm in the poor
      little thing, and always found her very handy and quick in carrying
      messages, and fetching what she wanted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fanny, with all her faults of ignorance and timidity, was fixed at
      Mansfield Park, and learning to transfer in its favour much of her
      attachment to her former home, grew up there not unhappily among her
      cousins. There was no positive ill-nature in Maria or Julia; and though
      Fanny was often mortified by their treatment of her, she thought too lowly
      of her own claims to feel injured by it.
    </p>
    <p>
      From about the time of her entering the family, Lady Bertram, in
      consequence of a little ill-health, and a great deal of indolence, gave up
      the house in town, which she had been used to occupy every spring, and
      remained wholly in the country, leaving Sir Thomas to attend his duty in
      Parliament, with whatever increase or diminution of comfort might arise
      from her absence. In the country, therefore, the Miss Bertrams continued
      to exercise their memories, practise their duets, and grow tall and
      womanly: and their father saw them becoming in person, manner, and
      accomplishments, everything that could satisfy his anxiety. His eldest son
      was careless and extravagant, and had already given him much uneasiness;
      but his other children promised him nothing but good. His daughters, he
      felt, while they retained the name of Bertram, must be giving it new
      grace, and in quitting it, he trusted, would extend its respectable
      alliances; and the character of Edmund, his strong good sense and
      uprightness of mind, bid most fairly for utility, honour, and happiness to
      himself and all his connexions. He was to be a clergyman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amid the cares and the complacency which his own children suggested, Sir
      Thomas did not forget to do what he could for the children of Mrs. Price:
      he assisted her liberally in the education and disposal of her sons as
      they became old enough for a determinate pursuit; and Fanny, though almost
      totally separated from her family, was sensible of the truest satisfaction
      in hearing of any kindness towards them, or of anything at all promising
      in their situation or conduct. Once, and once only, in the course of many
      years, had she the happiness of being with William. Of the rest she saw
      nothing: nobody seemed to think of her ever going amongst them again, even
      for a visit, nobody at home seemed to want her; but William determining,
      soon after her removal, to be a sailor, was invited to spend a week with
      his sister in Northamptonshire before he went to sea. Their eager
      affection in meeting, their exquisite delight in being together, their
      hours of happy mirth, and moments of serious conference, may be imagined;
      as well as the sanguine views and spirits of the boy even to the last, and
      the misery of the girl when he left her. Luckily the visit happened in the
      Christmas holidays, when she could directly look for comfort to her cousin
      Edmund; and he told her such charming things of what William was to do,
      and be hereafter, in consequence of his profession, as made her gradually
      admit that the separation might have some use. Edmund&rsquo;s friendship never
      failed her: his leaving Eton for Oxford made no change in his kind
      dispositions, and only afforded more frequent opportunities of proving
      them. Without any display of doing more than the rest, or any fear of
      doing too much, he was always true to her interests, and considerate of
      her feelings, trying to make her good qualities understood, and to conquer
      the diffidence which prevented their being more apparent; giving her
      advice, consolation, and encouragement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kept back as she was by everybody else, his single support could not bring
      her forward; but his attentions were otherwise of the highest importance
      in assisting the improvement of her mind, and extending its pleasures. He
      knew her to be clever, to have a quick apprehension as well as good sense,
      and a fondness for reading, which, properly directed, must be an education
      in itself. Miss Lee taught her French, and heard her read the daily
      portion of history; but he recommended the books which charmed her leisure
      hours, he encouraged her taste, and corrected her judgment: he made
      reading useful by talking to her of what she read, and heightened its
      attraction by judicious praise. In return for such services she loved him
      better than anybody in the world except William: her heart was divided
      between the two.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III
    </h2>
    <p>
      The first event of any importance in the family was the death of Mr.
      Norris, which happened when Fanny was about fifteen, and necessarily
      introduced alterations and novelties. Mrs. Norris, on quitting the
      Parsonage, removed first to the Park, and afterwards to a small house of
      Sir Thomas&rsquo;s in the village, and consoled herself for the loss of her
      husband by considering that she could do very well without him; and for
      her reduction of income by the evident necessity of stricter economy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The living was hereafter for Edmund; and, had his uncle died a few years
      sooner, it would have been duly given to some friend to hold till he were
      old enough for orders. But Tom&rsquo;s extravagance had, previous to that event,
      been so great as to render a different disposal of the next presentation
      necessary, and the younger brother must help to pay for the pleasures of
      the elder. There was another family living actually held for Edmund; but
      though this circumstance had made the arrangement somewhat easier to Sir
      Thomas&rsquo;s conscience, he could not but feel it to be an act of injustice,
      and he earnestly tried to impress his eldest son with the same conviction,
      in the hope of its producing a better effect than anything he had yet been
      able to say or do.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I blush for you, Tom,&rdquo; said he, in his most dignified manner; &ldquo;I blush
      for the expedient which I am driven on, and I trust I may pity your
      feelings as a brother on the occasion. You have robbed Edmund for ten,
      twenty, thirty years, perhaps for life, of more than half the income which
      ought to be his. It may hereafter be in my power, or in yours (I hope it
      will), to procure him better preferment; but it must not be forgotten that
      no benefit of that sort would have been beyond his natural claims on us,
      and that nothing can, in fact, be an equivalent for the certain advantage
      which he is now obliged to forego through the urgency of your debts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tom listened with some shame and some sorrow; but escaping as quickly as
      possible, could soon with cheerful selfishness reflect, firstly, that he
      had not been half so much in debt as some of his friends; secondly, that
      his father had made a most tiresome piece of work of it; and, thirdly,
      that the future incumbent, whoever he might be, would, in all probability,
      die very soon.
    </p>
    <p>
      On Mr. Norris&rsquo;s death the presentation became the right of a Dr. Grant,
      who came consequently to reside at Mansfield; and on proving to be a
      hearty man of forty-five, seemed likely to disappoint Mr. Bertram&rsquo;s
      calculations. But &ldquo;no, he was a short-necked, apoplectic sort of fellow,
      and, plied well with good things, would soon pop off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had a wife about fifteen years his junior, but no children; and they
      entered the neighbourhood with the usual fair report of being very
      respectable, agreeable people.
    </p>
    <p>
      The time was now come when Sir Thomas expected his sister-in-law to claim
      her share in their niece, the change in Mrs. Norris&rsquo;s situation, and the
      improvement in Fanny&rsquo;s age, seeming not merely to do away any former
      objection to their living together, but even to give it the most decided
      eligibility; and as his own circumstances were rendered less fair than
      heretofore, by some recent losses on his West India estate, in addition to
      his eldest son&rsquo;s extravagance, it became not undesirable to himself to be
      relieved from the expense of her support, and the obligation of her future
      provision. In the fullness of his belief that such a thing must be, he
      mentioned its probability to his wife; and the first time of the subject&rsquo;s
      occurring to her again happening to be when Fanny was present, she calmly
      observed to her, &ldquo;So, Fanny, you are going to leave us, and live with my
      sister. How shall you like it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fanny was too much surprised to do more than repeat her aunt&rsquo;s words,
      &ldquo;Going to leave you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my dear; why should you be astonished? You have been five years with
      us, and my sister always meant to take you when Mr. Norris died. But you
      must come up and tack on my patterns all the same.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The news was as disagreeable to Fanny as it had been unexpected. She had
      never received kindness from her aunt Norris, and could not love her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be very sorry to go away,&rdquo; said she, with a faltering voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I dare say you will; <i>that&rsquo;s</i> natural enough. I suppose you
      have had as little to vex you since you came into this house as any
      creature in the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope I am not ungrateful, aunt,&rdquo; said Fanny modestly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, my dear; I hope not. I have always found you a very good girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And am I never to live here again?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never, my dear; but you are sure of a comfortable home. It can make very
      little difference to you, whether you are in one house or the other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fanny left the room with a very sorrowful heart; she could not feel the
      difference to be so small, she could not think of living with her aunt
      with anything like satisfaction. As soon as she met with Edmund she told
      him her distress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cousin,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;something is going to happen which I do not like at
      all; and though you have often persuaded me into being reconciled to
      things that I disliked at first, you will not be able to do it now. I am
      going to live entirely with my aunt Norris.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; my aunt Bertram has just told me so. It is quite settled. I am to
      leave Mansfield Park, and go to the White House, I suppose, as soon as she
      is removed there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Fanny, and if the plan were not unpleasant to you, I should call it
      an excellent one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, cousin!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has everything else in its favour. My aunt is acting like a sensible
      woman in wishing for you. She is choosing a friend and companion exactly
      where she ought, and I am glad her love of money does not interfere. You
      will be what you ought to be to her. I hope it does not distress you very
      much, Fanny?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed it does: I cannot like it. I love this house and everything in it:
      I shall love nothing there. You know how uncomfortable I feel with her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can say nothing for her manner to you as a child; but it was the same
      with us all, or nearly so. She never knew how to be pleasant to children.
      But you are now of an age to be treated better; I think she is behaving
      better already; and when you are her only companion, you <i>must</i> be
      important to her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can never be important to any one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is to prevent you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everything. My situation, my foolishness and awkwardness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As to your foolishness and awkwardness, my dear Fanny, believe me, you
      never have a shadow of either, but in using the words so improperly. There
      is no reason in the world why you should not be important where you are
      known. You have good sense, and a sweet temper, and I am sure you have a
      grateful heart, that could never receive kindness without wishing to
      return it. I do not know any better qualifications for a friend and
      companion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are too kind,&rdquo; said Fanny, colouring at such praise; &ldquo;how shall I ever
      thank you as I ought, for thinking so well of me. Oh! cousin, if I am to
      go away, I shall remember your goodness to the last moment of my life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, indeed, Fanny, I should hope to be remembered at such a distance as
      the White House. You speak as if you were going two hundred miles off
      instead of only across the park; but you will belong to us almost as much
      as ever. The two families will be meeting every day in the year. The only
      difference will be that, living with your aunt, you will necessarily be
      brought forward as you ought to be. <i>Here</i> there are too many whom
      you can hide behind; but with <i>her</i> you will be forced to speak for
      yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I do not say so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must say it, and say it with pleasure. Mrs. Norris is much better
      fitted than my mother for having the charge of you now. She is of a temper
      to do a great deal for anybody she really interests herself about, and she
      will force you to do justice to your natural powers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fanny sighed, and said, &ldquo;I cannot see things as you do; but I ought to
      believe you to be right rather than myself, and I am very much obliged to
      you for trying to reconcile me to what must be. If I could suppose my aunt
      really to care for me, it would be delightful to feel myself of
      consequence to anybody. <i>Here</i>, I know, I am of none, and yet I love
      the place so well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The place, Fanny, is what you will not quit, though you quit the house.
      You will have as free a command of the park and gardens as ever. Even <i>your</i>
      constant little heart need not take fright at such a nominal change. You
      will have the same walks to frequent, the same library to choose from, the
      same people to look at, the same horse to ride.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very true. Yes, dear old grey pony! Ah! cousin, when I remember how much
      I used to dread riding, what terrors it gave me to hear it talked of as
      likely to do me good (oh! how I have trembled at my uncle&rsquo;s opening his
      lips if horses were talked of), and then think of the kind pains you took
      to reason and persuade me out of my fears, and convince me that I should
      like it after a little while, and feel how right you proved to be, I am
      inclined to hope you may always prophesy as well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I am quite convinced that your being with Mrs. Norris will be as good
      for your mind as riding has been for your health, and as much for your
      ultimate happiness too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So ended their discourse, which, for any very appropriate service it could
      render Fanny, might as well have been spared, for Mrs. Norris had not the
      smallest intention of taking her. It had never occurred to her, on the
      present occasion, but as a thing to be carefully avoided. To prevent its
      being expected, she had fixed on the smallest habitation which could rank
      as genteel among the buildings of Mansfield parish, the White House being
      only just large enough to receive herself and her servants, and allow a
      spare room for a friend, of which she made a very particular point. The
      spare rooms at the Parsonage had never been wanted, but the absolute
      necessity of a spare room for a friend was now never forgotten. Not all
      her precautions, however, could save her from being suspected of something
      better; or, perhaps, her very display of the importance of a spare room
      might have misled Sir Thomas to suppose it really intended for Fanny. Lady
      Bertram soon brought the matter to a certainty by carelessly observing to
      Mrs. Norris&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think, sister, we need not keep Miss Lee any longer, when Fanny goes to
      live with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Norris almost started. &ldquo;Live with me, dear Lady Bertram! what do you
      mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is she not to live with you? I thought you had settled it with Sir
      Thomas.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me! never. I never spoke a syllable about it to Sir Thomas, nor he to me.
      Fanny live with me! the last thing in the world for me to think of, or for
      anybody to wish that really knows us both. Good heaven! what could I do
      with Fanny? Me! a poor, helpless, forlorn widow, unfit for anything, my
      spirits quite broke down; what could I do with a girl at her time of life?
      A girl of fifteen! the very age of all others to need most attention and
      care, and put the cheerfullest spirits to the test! Sure Sir Thomas could
      not seriously expect such a thing! Sir Thomas is too much my friend.
      Nobody that wishes me well, I am sure, would propose it. How came Sir
      Thomas to speak to you about it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, I do not know. I suppose he thought it best.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what did he say? He could not say he <i>wished</i> me to take Fanny.
      I am sure in his heart he could not wish me to do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; he only said he thought it very likely; and I thought so too. We both
      thought it would be a comfort to you. But if you do not like it, there is
      no more to be said. She is no encumbrance here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear sister, if you consider my unhappy state, how can she be any comfort
      to me? Here am I, a poor desolate widow, deprived of the best of husbands,
      my health gone in attending and nursing him, my spirits still worse, all
      my peace in this world destroyed, with hardly enough to support me in the
      rank of a gentlewoman, and enable me to live so as not to disgrace the
      memory of the dear departed&mdash;what possible comfort could I have in
      taking such a charge upon me as Fanny? If I could wish it for my own sake,
      I would not do so unjust a thing by the poor girl. She is in good hands,
      and sure of doing well. I must struggle through my sorrows and
      difficulties as I can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you will not mind living by yourself quite alone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lady Bertram, I do not complain. I know I cannot live as I have done, but
      I must retrench where I can, and learn to be a better manager. I <i>have</i>
      <i>been</i> a liberal housekeeper enough, but I shall not be ashamed to
      practise economy now. My situation is as much altered as my income. A
      great many things were due from poor Mr. Norris, as clergyman of the
      parish, that cannot be expected from me. It is unknown how much was
      consumed in our kitchen by odd comers and goers. At the White House,
      matters must be better looked after. I <i>must</i> live within my income,
      or I shall be miserable; and I own it would give me great satisfaction to
      be able to do rather more, to lay by a little at the end of the year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare say you will. You always do, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My object, Lady Bertram, is to be of use to those that come after me. It
      is for your children&rsquo;s good that I wish to be richer. I have nobody else
      to care for, but I should be very glad to think I could leave a little
      trifle among them worth their having.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very good, but do not trouble yourself about them. They are sure
      of being well provided for. Sir Thomas will take care of that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, you know, Sir Thomas&rsquo;s means will be rather straitened if the
      Antigua estate is to make such poor returns.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! <i>that</i> will soon be settled. Sir Thomas has been writing about
      it, I know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Lady Bertram,&rdquo; said Mrs. Norris, moving to go, &ldquo;I can only say that
      my sole desire is to be of use to your family: and so, if Sir Thomas
      should ever speak again about my taking Fanny, you will be able to say
      that my health and spirits put it quite out of the question; besides that,
      I really should not have a bed to give her, for I must keep a spare room
      for a friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Bertram repeated enough of this conversation to her husband to
      convince him how much he had mistaken his sister-in-law&rsquo;s views; and she
      was from that moment perfectly safe from all expectation, or the slightest
      allusion to it from him. He could not but wonder at her refusing to do
      anything for a niece whom she had been so forward to adopt; but, as she
      took early care to make him, as well as Lady Bertram, understand that
      whatever she possessed was designed for their family, he soon grew
      reconciled to a distinction which, at the same time that it was
      advantageous and complimentary to them, would enable him better to provide
      for Fanny himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fanny soon learnt how unnecessary had been her fears of a removal; and her
      spontaneous, untaught felicity on the discovery, conveyed some consolation
      to Edmund for his disappointment in what he had expected to be so
      essentially serviceable to her. Mrs. Norris took possession of the White
      House, the Grants arrived at the Parsonage, and these events over,
      everything at Mansfield went on for some time as usual.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Grants showing a disposition to be friendly and sociable, gave great
      satisfaction in the main among their new acquaintance. They had their
      faults, and Mrs. Norris soon found them out. The Doctor was very fond of
      eating, and would have a good dinner every day; and Mrs. Grant, instead of
      contriving to gratify him at little expense, gave her cook as high wages
      as they did at Mansfield Park, and was scarcely ever seen in her offices.
      Mrs. Norris could not speak with any temper of such grievances, nor of the
      quantity of butter and eggs that were regularly consumed in the house.
      &ldquo;Nobody loved plenty and hospitality more than herself; nobody more hated
      pitiful doings; the Parsonage, she believed, had never been wanting in
      comforts of any sort, had never borne a bad character in <i>her</i> <i>time</i>,
      but this was a way of going on that she could not understand. A fine lady
      in a country parsonage was quite out of place. <i>Her</i> store-room, she
      thought, might have been good enough for Mrs. Grant to go into. Inquire
      where she would, she could not find out that Mrs. Grant had ever had more
      than five thousand pounds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Bertram listened without much interest to this sort of invective. She
      could not enter into the wrongs of an economist, but she felt all the
      injuries of beauty in Mrs. Grant&rsquo;s being so well settled in life without
      being handsome, and expressed her astonishment on that point almost as
      often, though not so diffusely, as Mrs. Norris discussed the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      These opinions had been hardly canvassed a year before another event arose
      of such importance in the family, as might fairly claim some place in the
      thoughts and conversation of the ladies. Sir Thomas found it expedient to
      go to Antigua himself, for the better arrangement of his affairs, and he
      took his eldest son with him, in the hope of detaching him from some bad
      connexions at home. They left England with the probability of being nearly
      a twelvemonth absent.
    </p>
    <p>
      The necessity of the measure in a pecuniary light, and the hope of its
      utility to his son, reconciled Sir Thomas to the effort of quitting the
      rest of his family, and of leaving his daughters to the direction of
      others at their present most interesting time of life. He could not think
      Lady Bertram quite equal to supply his place with them, or rather, to
      perform what should have been her own; but, in Mrs. Norris&rsquo;s watchful
      attention, and in Edmund&rsquo;s judgment, he had sufficient confidence to make
      him go without fears for their conduct.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Bertram did not at all like to have her husband leave her; but she
      was not disturbed by any alarm for his safety, or solicitude for his
      comfort, being one of those persons who think nothing can be dangerous, or
      difficult, or fatiguing to anybody but themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Miss Bertrams were much to be pitied on the occasion: not for their
      sorrow, but for their want of it. Their father was no object of love to
      them; he had never seemed the friend of their pleasures, and his absence
      was unhappily most welcome. They were relieved by it from all restraint;
      and without aiming at one gratification that would probably have been
      forbidden by Sir Thomas, they felt themselves immediately at their own
      disposal, and to have every indulgence within their reach. Fanny&rsquo;s relief,
      and her consciousness of it, were quite equal to her cousins&rsquo;; but a more
      tender nature suggested that her feelings were ungrateful, and she really
      grieved because she could not grieve. &ldquo;Sir Thomas, who had done so much
      for her and her brothers, and who was gone perhaps never to return! that
      she should see him go without a tear! it was a shameful insensibility.&rdquo; He
      had said to her, moreover, on the very last morning, that he hoped she
      might see William again in the course of the ensuing winter, and had
      charged her to write and invite him to Mansfield as soon as the squadron
      to which he belonged should be known to be in England. &ldquo;This was so
      thoughtful and kind!&rdquo; and would he only have smiled upon her, and called
      her &ldquo;my dear Fanny,&rdquo; while he said it, every former frown or cold address
      might have been forgotten. But he had ended his speech in a way to sink
      her in sad mortification, by adding, &ldquo;If William does come to Mansfield, I
      hope you may be able to convince him that the many years which have passed
      since you parted have not been spent on your side entirely without
      improvement; though, I fear, he must find his sister at sixteen in some
      respects too much like his sister at ten.&rdquo; She cried bitterly over this
      reflection when her uncle was gone; and her cousins, on seeing her with
      red eyes, set her down as a hypocrite.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV
    </h2>
    <p>
      Tom Bertram had of late spent so little of his time at home that he could
      be only nominally missed; and Lady Bertram was soon astonished to find how
      very well they did even without his father, how well Edmund could supply
      his place in carving, talking to the steward, writing to the attorney,
      settling with the servants, and equally saving her from all possible
      fatigue or exertion in every particular but that of directing her letters.
    </p>
    <p>
      The earliest intelligence of the travellers&rsquo; safe arrival at Antigua,
      after a favourable voyage, was received; though not before Mrs. Norris had
      been indulging in very dreadful fears, and trying to make Edmund
      participate them whenever she could get him alone; and as she depended on
      being the first person made acquainted with any fatal catastrophe, she had
      already arranged the manner of breaking it to all the others, when Sir
      Thomas&rsquo;s assurances of their both being alive and well made it necessary
      to lay by her agitation and affectionate preparatory speeches for a while.
    </p>
    <p>
      The winter came and passed without their being called for; the accounts
      continued perfectly good; and Mrs. Norris, in promoting gaieties for her
      nieces, assisting their toilets, displaying their accomplishments, and
      looking about for their future husbands, had so much to do as, in addition
      to all her own household cares, some interference in those of her sister,
      and Mrs. Grant&rsquo;s wasteful doings to overlook, left her very little
      occasion to be occupied in fears for the absent.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Miss Bertrams were now fully established among the belles of the
      neighbourhood; and as they joined to beauty and brilliant acquirements a
      manner naturally easy, and carefully formed to general civility and
      obligingness, they possessed its favour as well as its admiration. Their
      vanity was in such good order that they seemed to be quite free from it,
      and gave themselves no airs; while the praises attending such behaviour,
      secured and brought round by their aunt, served to strengthen them in
      believing they had no faults.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Bertram did not go into public with her daughters. She was too
      indolent even to accept a mother&rsquo;s gratification in witnessing their
      success and enjoyment at the expense of any personal trouble, and the
      charge was made over to her sister, who desired nothing better than a post
      of such honourable representation, and very thoroughly relished the means
      it afforded her of mixing in society without having horses to hire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fanny had no share in the festivities of the season; but she enjoyed being
      avowedly useful as her aunt&rsquo;s companion when they called away the rest of
      the family; and, as Miss Lee had left Mansfield, she naturally became
      everything to Lady Bertram during the night of a ball or a party. She
      talked to her, listened to her, read to her; and the tranquillity of such
      evenings, her perfect security in such a <i>tete-a-tete</i> from any sound
      of unkindness, was unspeakably welcome to a mind which had seldom known a
      pause in its alarms or embarrassments. As to her cousins&rsquo; gaieties, she
      loved to hear an account of them, especially of the balls, and whom Edmund
      had danced with; but thought too lowly of her own situation to imagine she
      should ever be admitted to the same, and listened, therefore, without an
      idea of any nearer concern in them. Upon the whole, it was a comfortable
      winter to her; for though it brought no William to England, the
      never-failing hope of his arrival was worth much.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ensuing spring deprived her of her valued friend, the old grey pony;
      and for some time she was in danger of feeling the loss in her health as
      well as in her affections; for in spite of the acknowledged importance of
      her riding on horse-back, no measures were taken for mounting her again,
      &ldquo;because,&rdquo; as it was observed by her aunts, &ldquo;she might ride one of her
      cousin&rsquo;s horses at any time when they did not want them,&rdquo; and as the Miss
      Bertrams regularly wanted their horses every fine day, and had no idea of
      carrying their obliging manners to the sacrifice of any real pleasure,
      that time, of course, never came. They took their cheerful rides in the
      fine mornings of April and May; and Fanny either sat at home the whole day
      with one aunt, or walked beyond her strength at the instigation of the
      other: Lady Bertram holding exercise to be as unnecessary for everybody as
      it was unpleasant to herself; and Mrs. Norris, who was walking all day,
      thinking everybody ought to walk as much. Edmund was absent at this time,
      or the evil would have been earlier remedied. When he returned, to
      understand how Fanny was situated, and perceived its ill effects, there
      seemed with him but one thing to be done; and that &ldquo;Fanny must have a
      horse&rdquo; was the resolute declaration with which he opposed whatever could
      be urged by the supineness of his mother, or the economy of his aunt, to
      make it appear unimportant. Mrs. Norris could not help thinking that some
      steady old thing might be found among the numbers belonging to the Park
      that would do vastly well; or that one might be borrowed of the steward;
      or that perhaps Dr. Grant might now and then lend them the pony he sent to
      the post. She could not but consider it as absolutely unnecessary, and
      even improper, that Fanny should have a regular lady&rsquo;s horse of her own,
      in the style of her cousins. She was sure Sir Thomas had never intended
      it: and she must say that, to be making such a purchase in his absence,
      and adding to the great expenses of his stable, at a time when a large
      part of his income was unsettled, seemed to her very unjustifiable. &ldquo;Fanny
      must have a horse,&rdquo; was Edmund&rsquo;s only reply. Mrs. Norris could not see it
      in the same light. Lady Bertram did: she entirely agreed with her son as
      to the necessity of it, and as to its being considered necessary by his
      father; she only pleaded against there being any hurry; she only wanted
      him to wait till Sir Thomas&rsquo;s return, and then Sir Thomas might settle it
      all himself. He would be at home in September, and where would be the harm
      of only waiting till September?
    </p>
    <p>
      Though Edmund was much more displeased with his aunt than with his mother,
      as evincing least regard for her niece, he could not help paying more
      attention to what she said; and at length determined on a method of
      proceeding which would obviate the risk of his father&rsquo;s thinking he had
      done too much, and at the same time procure for Fanny the immediate means
      of exercise, which he could not bear she should be without. He had three
      horses of his own, but not one that would carry a woman. Two of them were
      hunters; the third, a useful road-horse: this third he resolved to
      exchange for one that his cousin might ride; he knew where such a one was
      to be met with; and having once made up his mind, the whole business was
      soon completed. The new mare proved a treasure; with a very little trouble
      she became exactly calculated for the purpose, and Fanny was then put in
      almost full possession of her. She had not supposed before that anything
      could ever suit her like the old grey pony; but her delight in Edmund&rsquo;s
      mare was far beyond any former pleasure of the sort; and the addition it
      was ever receiving in the consideration of that kindness from which her
      pleasure sprung, was beyond all her words to express. She regarded her
      cousin as an example of everything good and great, as possessing worth
      which no one but herself could ever appreciate, and as entitled to such
      gratitude from her as no feelings could be strong enough to pay. Her
      sentiments towards him were compounded of all that was respectful,
      grateful, confiding, and tender.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the horse continued in name, as well as fact, the property of Edmund,
      Mrs. Norris could tolerate its being for Fanny&rsquo;s use; and had Lady Bertram
      ever thought about her own objection again, he might have been excused in
      her eyes for not waiting till Sir Thomas&rsquo;s return in September, for when
      September came Sir Thomas was still abroad, and without any near prospect
      of finishing his business. Unfavourable circumstances had suddenly arisen
      at a moment when he was beginning to turn all his thoughts towards
      England; and the very great uncertainty in which everything was then
      involved determined him on sending home his son, and waiting the final
      arrangement by himself. Tom arrived safely, bringing an excellent account
      of his father&rsquo;s health; but to very little purpose, as far as Mrs. Norris
      was concerned. Sir Thomas&rsquo;s sending away his son seemed to her so like a
      parent&rsquo;s care, under the influence of a foreboding of evil to himself,
      that she could not help feeling dreadful presentiments; and as the long
      evenings of autumn came on, was so terribly haunted by these ideas, in the
      sad solitariness of her cottage, as to be obliged to take daily refuge in
      the dining-room of the Park. The return of winter engagements, however,
      was not without its effect; and in the course of their progress, her mind
      became so pleasantly occupied in superintending the fortunes of her eldest
      niece, as tolerably to quiet her nerves. &ldquo;If poor Sir Thomas were fated
      never to return, it would be peculiarly consoling to see their dear Maria
      well married,&rdquo; she very often thought; always when they were in the
      company of men of fortune, and particularly on the introduction of a young
      man who had recently succeeded to one of the largest estates and finest
      places in the country.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Rushworth was from the first struck with the beauty of Miss Bertram,
      and, being inclined to marry, soon fancied himself in love. He was a heavy
      young man, with not more than common sense; but as there was nothing
      disagreeable in his figure or address, the young lady was well pleased
      with her conquest. Being now in her twenty-first year, Maria Bertram was
      beginning to think matrimony a duty; and as a marriage with Mr. Rushworth
      would give her the enjoyment of a larger income than her father&rsquo;s, as well
      as ensure her the house in town, which was now a prime object, it became,
      by the same rule of moral obligation, her evident duty to marry Mr.
      Rushworth if she could. Mrs. Norris was most zealous in promoting the
      match, by every suggestion and contrivance likely to enhance its
      desirableness to either party; and, among other means, by seeking an
      intimacy with the gentleman&rsquo;s mother, who at present lived with him, and
      to whom she even forced Lady Bertram to go through ten miles of
      indifferent road to pay a morning visit. It was not long before a good
      understanding took place between this lady and herself. Mrs. Rushworth
      acknowledged herself very desirous that her son should marry, and declared
      that of all the young ladies she had ever seen, Miss Bertram seemed, by
      her amiable qualities and accomplishments, the best adapted to make him
      happy. Mrs. Norris accepted the compliment, and admired the nice
      discernment of character which could so well distinguish merit. Maria was
      indeed the pride and delight of them all&mdash;perfectly faultless&mdash;an
      angel; and, of course, so surrounded by admirers, must be difficult in her
      choice: but yet, as far as Mrs. Norris could allow herself to decide on so
      short an acquaintance, Mr. Rushworth appeared precisely the young man to
      deserve and attach her.
    </p>
    <p>
      After dancing with each other at a proper number of balls, the young
      people justified these opinions, and an engagement, with a due reference
      to the absent Sir Thomas, was entered into, much to the satisfaction of
      their respective families, and of the general lookers-on of the
      neighbourhood, who had, for many weeks past, felt the expediency of Mr.
      Rushworth&rsquo;s marrying Miss Bertram.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was some months before Sir Thomas&rsquo;s consent could be received; but, in
      the meanwhile, as no one felt a doubt of his most cordial pleasure in the
      connexion, the intercourse of the two families was carried on without
      restraint, and no other attempt made at secrecy than Mrs. Norris&rsquo;s talking
      of it everywhere as a matter not to be talked of at present.
    </p>
    <p>
      Edmund was the only one of the family who could see a fault in the
      business; but no representation of his aunt&rsquo;s could induce him to find Mr.
      Rushworth a desirable companion. He could allow his sister to be the best
      judge of her own happiness, but he was not pleased that her happiness
      should centre in a large income; nor could he refrain from often saying to
      himself, in Mr. Rushworth&rsquo;s company&mdash;&ldquo;If this man had not twelve
      thousand a year, he would be a very stupid fellow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sir Thomas, however, was truly happy in the prospect of an alliance so
      unquestionably advantageous, and of which he heard nothing but the
      perfectly good and agreeable. It was a connexion exactly of the right sort&mdash;in
      the same county, and the same interest&mdash;and his most hearty
      concurrence was conveyed as soon as possible. He only conditioned that the
      marriage should not take place before his return, which he was again
      looking eagerly forward to. He wrote in April, and had strong hopes of
      settling everything to his entire satisfaction, and leaving Antigua before
      the end of the summer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was the state of affairs in the month of July; and Fanny had just
      reached her eighteenth year, when the society of the village received an
      addition in the brother and sister of Mrs. Grant, a Mr. and Miss Crawford,
      the children of her mother by a second marriage. They were young people of
      fortune. The son had a good estate in Norfolk, the daughter twenty
      thousand pounds. As children, their sister had been always very fond of
      them; but, as her own marriage had been soon followed by the death of
      their common parent, which left them to the care of a brother of their
      father, of whom Mrs. Grant knew nothing, she had scarcely seen them since.
      In their uncle&rsquo;s house they had found a kind home. Admiral and Mrs.
      Crawford, though agreeing in nothing else, were united in affection for
      these children, or, at least, were no farther adverse in their feelings
      than that each had their favourite, to whom they showed the greatest
      fondness of the two. The Admiral delighted in the boy, Mrs. Crawford doted
      on the girl; and it was the lady&rsquo;s death which now obliged her <i>protegee</i>,
      after some months&rsquo; further trial at her uncle&rsquo;s house, to find another
      home. Admiral Crawford was a man of vicious conduct, who chose, instead of
      retaining his niece, to bring his mistress under his own roof; and to this
      Mrs. Grant was indebted for her sister&rsquo;s proposal of coming to her, a
      measure quite as welcome on one side as it could be expedient on the
      other; for Mrs. Grant, having by this time run through the usual resources
      of ladies residing in the country without a family of children&mdash;having
      more than filled her favourite sitting-room with pretty furniture, and
      made a choice collection of plants and poultry&mdash;was very much in want
      of some variety at home. The arrival, therefore, of a sister whom she had
      always loved, and now hoped to retain with her as long as she remained
      single, was highly agreeable; and her chief anxiety was lest Mansfield
      should not satisfy the habits of a young woman who had been mostly used to
      London.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Crawford was not entirely free from similar apprehensions, though
      they arose principally from doubts of her sister&rsquo;s style of living and
      tone of society; and it was not till after she had tried in vain to
      persuade her brother to settle with her at his own country house, that she
      could resolve to hazard herself among her other relations. To anything
      like a permanence of abode, or limitation of society, Henry Crawford had,
      unluckily, a great dislike: he could not accommodate his sister in an
      article of such importance; but he escorted her, with the utmost kindness,
      into Northamptonshire, and as readily engaged to fetch her away again, at
      half an hour&rsquo;s notice, whenever she were weary of the place.
    </p>
    <p>
      The meeting was very satisfactory on each side. Miss Crawford found a
      sister without preciseness or rusticity, a sister&rsquo;s husband who looked the
      gentleman, and a house commodious and well fitted up; and Mrs. Grant
      received in those whom she hoped to love better than ever a young man and
      woman of very prepossessing appearance. Mary Crawford was remarkably
      pretty; Henry, though not handsome, had air and countenance; the manners
      of both were lively and pleasant, and Mrs. Grant immediately gave them
      credit for everything else. She was delighted with each, but Mary was her
      dearest object; and having never been able to glory in beauty of her own,
      she thoroughly enjoyed the power of being proud of her sister&rsquo;s. She had
      not waited her arrival to look out for a suitable match for her: she had
      fixed on Tom Bertram; the eldest son of a baronet was not too good for a
      girl of twenty thousand pounds, with all the elegance and accomplishments
      which Mrs. Grant foresaw in her; and being a warm-hearted, unreserved
      woman, Mary had not been three hours in the house before she told her what
      she had planned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Crawford was glad to find a family of such consequence so very near
      them, and not at all displeased either at her sister&rsquo;s early care, or the
      choice it had fallen on. Matrimony was her object, provided she could
      marry well: and having seen Mr. Bertram in town, she knew that objection
      could no more be made to his person than to his situation in life. While
      she treated it as a joke, therefore, she did not forget to think of it
      seriously. The scheme was soon repeated to Henry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now,&rdquo; added Mrs. Grant, &ldquo;I have thought of something to make it
      complete. I should dearly love to settle you both in this country; and
      therefore, Henry, you shall marry the youngest Miss Bertram, a nice,
      handsome, good-humoured, accomplished girl, who will make you very happy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Henry bowed and thanked her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear sister,&rdquo; said Mary, &ldquo;if you can persuade him into anything of the
      sort, it will be a fresh matter of delight to me to find myself allied to
      anybody so clever, and I shall only regret that you have not half a dozen
      daughters to dispose of. If you can persuade Henry to marry, you must have
      the address of a Frenchwoman. All that English abilities can do has been
      tried already. I have three very particular friends who have been all
      dying for him in their turn; and the pains which they, their mothers (very
      clever women), as well as my dear aunt and myself, have taken to reason,
      coax, or trick him into marrying, is inconceivable! He is the most
      horrible flirt that can be imagined. If your Miss Bertrams do not like to
      have their hearts broke, let them avoid Henry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear brother, I will not believe this of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I am sure you are too good. You will be kinder than Mary. You will
      allow for the doubts of youth and inexperience. I am of a cautious temper,
      and unwilling to risk my happiness in a hurry. Nobody can think more
      highly of the matrimonial state than myself. I consider the blessing of a
      wife as most justly described in those discreet lines of the poet&mdash;&lsquo;Heaven&rsquo;s
      <i>last</i> best gift.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, Mrs. Grant, you see how he dwells on one word, and only look at
      his smile. I assure you he is very detestable; the Admiral&rsquo;s lessons have
      quite spoiled him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I pay very little regard,&rdquo; said Mrs. Grant, &ldquo;to what any young person
      says on the subject of marriage. If they profess a disinclination for it,
      I only set it down that they have not yet seen the right person.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Grant laughingly congratulated Miss Crawford on feeling no
      disinclination to the state herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes! I am not at all ashamed of it. I would have everybody marry if
      they can do it properly: I do not like to have people throw themselves
      away; but everybody should marry as soon as they can do it to advantage.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V
    </h2>
    <p>
      The young people were pleased with each other from the first. On each side
      there was much to attract, and their acquaintance soon promised as early
      an intimacy as good manners would warrant. Miss Crawford&rsquo;s beauty did her
      no disservice with the Miss Bertrams. They were too handsome themselves to
      dislike any woman for being so too, and were almost as much charmed as
      their brothers with her lively dark eye, clear brown complexion, and
      general prettiness. Had she been tall, full formed, and fair, it might
      have been more of a trial: but as it was, there could be no comparison;
      and she was most allowably a sweet, pretty girl, while they were the
      finest young women in the country.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her brother was not handsome: no, when they first saw him he was
      absolutely plain, black and plain; but still he was the gentleman, with a
      pleasing address. The second meeting proved him not so very plain: he was
      plain, to be sure, but then he had so much countenance, and his teeth were
      so good, and he was so well made, that one soon forgot he was plain; and
      after a third interview, after dining in company with him at the
      Parsonage, he was no longer allowed to be called so by anybody. He was, in
      fact, the most agreeable young man the sisters had ever known, and they
      were equally delighted with him. Miss Bertram&rsquo;s engagement made him in
      equity the property of Julia, of which Julia was fully aware; and before
      he had been at Mansfield a week, she was quite ready to be fallen in love
      with.
    </p>
    <p>
      Maria&rsquo;s notions on the subject were more confused and indistinct. She did
      not want to see or understand. &ldquo;There could be no harm in her liking an
      agreeable man&mdash;everybody knew her situation&mdash;Mr. Crawford must
      take care of himself.&rdquo; Mr. Crawford did not mean to be in any danger! the
      Miss Bertrams were worth pleasing, and were ready to be pleased; and he
      began with no object but of making them like him. He did not want them to
      die of love; but with sense and temper which ought to have made him judge
      and feel better, he allowed himself great latitude on such points.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I like your Miss Bertrams exceedingly, sister,&rdquo; said he, as he returned
      from attending them to their carriage after the said dinner visit; &ldquo;they
      are very elegant, agreeable girls.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So they are indeed, and I am delighted to hear you say it. But you like
      Julia best.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes! I like Julia best.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But do you really? for Miss Bertram is in general thought the
      handsomest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I should suppose. She has the advantage in every feature, and I prefer
      her countenance; but I like Julia best; Miss Bertram is certainly the
      handsomest, and I have found her the most agreeable, but I shall always
      like Julia best, because you order me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall not talk to you, Henry, but I know you <i>will</i> like her best
      at last.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not I tell you that I like her best <i>at</i> <i>first</i>?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And besides, Miss Bertram is engaged. Remember that, my dear brother. Her
      choice is made.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and I like her the better for it. An engaged woman is always more
      agreeable than a disengaged. She is satisfied with herself. Her cares are
      over, and she feels that she may exert all her powers of pleasing without
      suspicion. All is safe with a lady engaged: no harm can be done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, as to that, Mr. Rushworth is a very good sort of young man, and it
      is a great match for her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Miss Bertram does not care three straws for him; <i>that</i> is your
      opinion of your intimate friend. <i>I</i> do not subscribe to it. I am
      sure Miss Bertram is very much attached to Mr. Rushworth. I could see it
      in her eyes, when he was mentioned. I think too well of Miss Bertram to
      suppose she would ever give her hand without her heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mary, how shall we manage him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must leave him to himself, I believe. Talking does no good. He will be
      taken in at last.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I would not have him <i>taken</i> <i>in</i>; I would not have him
      duped; I would have it all fair and honourable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh dear! let him stand his chance and be taken in. It will do just as
      well. Everybody is taken in at some period or other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not always in marriage, dear Mary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In marriage especially. With all due respect to such of the present
      company as chance to be married, my dear Mrs. Grant, there is not one in a
      hundred of either sex who is not taken in when they marry. Look where I
      will, I see that it <i>is</i> so; and I feel that it <i>must</i> be so,
      when I consider that it is, of all transactions, the one in which people
      expect most from others, and are least honest themselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! You have been in a bad school for matrimony, in Hill Street.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My poor aunt had certainly little cause to love the state; but, however,
      speaking from my own observation, it is a manoeuvring business. I know so
      many who have married in the full expectation and confidence of some one
      particular advantage in the connexion, or accomplishment, or good quality
      in the person, who have found themselves entirely deceived, and been
      obliged to put up with exactly the reverse. What is this but a take in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear child, there must be a little imagination here. I beg your
      pardon, but I cannot quite believe you. Depend upon it, you see but half.
      You see the evil, but you do not see the consolation. There will be little
      rubs and disappointments everywhere, and we are all apt to expect too
      much; but then, if one scheme of happiness fails, human nature turns to
      another; if the first calculation is wrong, we make a second better: we
      find comfort somewhere&mdash;and those evil-minded observers, dearest
      Mary, who make much of a little, are more taken in and deceived than the
      parties themselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well done, sister! I honour your <i>esprit</i> <i>du</i> <i>corps</i>.
      When I am a wife, I mean to be just as staunch myself; and I wish my
      friends in general would be so too. It would save me many a heartache.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are as bad as your brother, Mary; but we will cure you both.
      Mansfield shall cure you both, and without any taking in. Stay with us,
      and we will cure you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Crawfords, without wanting to be cured, were very willing to stay.
      Mary was satisfied with the Parsonage as a present home, and Henry equally
      ready to lengthen his visit. He had come, intending to spend only a few
      days with them; but Mansfield promised well, and there was nothing to call
      him elsewhere. It delighted Mrs. Grant to keep them both with her, and Dr.
      Grant was exceedingly well contented to have it so: a talking pretty young
      woman like Miss Crawford is always pleasant society to an indolent,
      stay-at-home man; and Mr. Crawford&rsquo;s being his guest was an excuse for
      drinking claret every day.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Miss Bertrams&rsquo; admiration of Mr. Crawford was more rapturous than
      anything which Miss Crawford&rsquo;s habits made her likely to feel. She
      acknowledged, however, that the Mr. Bertrams were very fine young men,
      that two such young men were not often seen together even in London, and
      that their manners, particularly those of the eldest, were very good. <i>He</i>
      had been much in London, and had more liveliness and gallantry than
      Edmund, and must, therefore, be preferred; and, indeed, his being the
      eldest was another strong claim. She had felt an early presentiment that
      she <i>should</i> like the eldest best. She knew it was her way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom Bertram must have been thought pleasant, indeed, at any rate; he was
      the sort of young man to be generally liked, his agreeableness was of the
      kind to be oftener found agreeable than some endowments of a higher stamp,
      for he had easy manners, excellent spirits, a large acquaintance, and a
      great deal to say; and the reversion of Mansfield Park, and a baronetcy,
      did no harm to all this. Miss Crawford soon felt that he and his situation
      might do. She looked about her with due consideration, and found almost
      everything in his favour: a park, a real park, five miles round, a
      spacious modern-built house, so well placed and well screened as to
      deserve to be in any collection of engravings of gentlemen&rsquo;s seats in the
      kingdom, and wanting only to be completely new furnished&mdash;pleasant
      sisters, a quiet mother, and an agreeable man himself&mdash;with the
      advantage of being tied up from much gaming at present by a promise to his
      father, and of being Sir Thomas hereafter. It might do very well; she
      believed she should accept him; and she began accordingly to interest
      herself a little about the horse which he had to run at the B&mdash;&mdash;
      races.
    </p>
    <p>
      These races were to call him away not long after their acquaintance began;
      and as it appeared that the family did not, from his usual goings on,
      expect him back again for many weeks, it would bring his passion to an
      early proof. Much was said on his side to induce her to attend the races,
      and schemes were made for a large party to them, with all the eagerness of
      inclination, but it would only do to be talked of.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Fanny, what was <i>she</i> doing and thinking all this while? and what
      was <i>her</i> opinion of the newcomers? Few young ladies of eighteen
      could be less called on to speak their opinion than Fanny. In a quiet way,
      very little attended to, she paid her tribute of admiration to Miss
      Crawford&rsquo;s beauty; but as she still continued to think Mr. Crawford very
      plain, in spite of her two cousins having repeatedly proved the contrary,
      she never mentioned <i>him</i>. The notice, which she excited herself, was
      to this effect. &ldquo;I begin now to understand you all, except Miss Price,&rdquo;
       said Miss Crawford, as she was walking with the Mr. Bertrams. &ldquo;Pray, is
      she out, or is she not? I am puzzled. She dined at the Parsonage, with the
      rest of you, which seemed like being <i>out</i>; and yet she says so
      little, that I can hardly suppose she <i>is</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Edmund, to whom this was chiefly addressed, replied, &ldquo;I believe I know
      what you mean, but I will not undertake to answer the question. My cousin
      is grown up. She has the age and sense of a woman, but the outs and not
      outs are beyond me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet, in general, nothing can be more easily ascertained. The
      distinction is so broad. Manners as well as appearance are, generally
      speaking, so totally different. Till now, I could not have supposed it
      possible to be mistaken as to a girl&rsquo;s being out or not. A girl not out
      has always the same sort of dress: a close bonnet, for instance; looks
      very demure, and never says a word. You may smile, but it is so, I assure
      you; and except that it is sometimes carried a little too far, it is all
      very proper. Girls should be quiet and modest. The most objectionable part
      is, that the alteration of manners on being introduced into company is
      frequently too sudden. They sometimes pass in such very little time from
      reserve to quite the opposite&mdash;to confidence! <i>That</i> is the
      faulty part of the present system. One does not like to see a girl of
      eighteen or nineteen so immediately up to every thing&mdash;and perhaps
      when one has seen her hardly able to speak the year before. Mr. Bertram, I
      dare say <i>you</i> have sometimes met with such changes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe I have, but this is hardly fair; I see what you are at. You are
      quizzing me and Miss Anderson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, indeed. Miss Anderson! I do not know who or what you mean. I am quite
      in the dark. But I <i>will</i> quiz you with a great deal of pleasure, if
      you will tell me what about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! you carry it off very well, but I cannot be quite so far imposed on.
      You must have had Miss Anderson in your eye, in describing an altered
      young lady. You paint too accurately for mistake. It was exactly so. The
      Andersons of Baker Street. We were speaking of them the other day, you
      know. Edmund, you have heard me mention Charles Anderson. The circumstance
      was precisely as this lady has represented it. When Anderson first
      introduced me to his family, about two years ago, his sister was not <i>out</i>,
      and I could not get her to speak to me. I sat there an hour one morning
      waiting for Anderson, with only her and a little girl or two in the room,
      the governess being sick or run away, and the mother in and out every
      moment with letters of business, and I could hardly get a word or a look
      from the young lady&mdash;nothing like a civil answer&mdash;she screwed up
      her mouth, and turned from me with such an air! I did not see her again
      for a twelvemonth. She was then <i>out</i>. I met her at Mrs. Holford&rsquo;s,
      and did not recollect her. She came up to me, claimed me as an
      acquaintance, stared me out of countenance; and talked and laughed till I
      did not know which way to look. I felt that I must be the jest of the room
      at the time, and Miss Crawford, it is plain, has heard the story.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And a very pretty story it is, and with more truth in it, I dare say,
      than does credit to Miss Anderson. It is too common a fault. Mothers
      certainly have not yet got quite the right way of managing their
      daughters. I do not know where the error lies. I do not pretend to set
      people right, but I do see that they are often wrong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those who are showing the world what female manners <i>should</i> be,&rdquo;
       said Mr. Bertram gallantly, &ldquo;are doing a great deal to set them right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The error is plain enough,&rdquo; said the less courteous Edmund; &ldquo;such girls
      are ill brought up. They are given wrong notions from the beginning. They
      are always acting upon motives of vanity, and there is no more real
      modesty in their behaviour <i>before</i> they appear in public than
      afterwards.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not know,&rdquo; replied Miss Crawford hesitatingly. &ldquo;Yes, I cannot agree
      with you there. It is certainly the modestest part of the business. It is
      much worse to have girls not out give themselves the same airs and take
      the same liberties as if they were, which I have seen done. That is worse
      than anything&mdash;quite disgusting!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, <i>that</i> is very inconvenient indeed,&rdquo; said Mr. Bertram. &ldquo;It
      leads one astray; one does not know what to do. The close bonnet and
      demure air you describe so well (and nothing was ever juster), tell one
      what is expected; but I got into a dreadful scrape last year from the want
      of them. I went down to Ramsgate for a week with a friend last September,
      just after my return from the West Indies. My friend Sneyd&mdash;you have
      heard me speak of Sneyd, Edmund&mdash;his father, and mother, and sisters,
      were there, all new to me. When we reached Albion Place they were out; we
      went after them, and found them on the pier: Mrs. and the two Miss Sneyds,
      with others of their acquaintance. I made my bow in form; and as Mrs.
      Sneyd was surrounded by men, attached myself to one of her daughters,
      walked by her side all the way home, and made myself as agreeable as I
      could; the young lady perfectly easy in her manners, and as ready to talk
      as to listen. I had not a suspicion that I could be doing anything wrong.
      They looked just the same: both well-dressed, with veils and parasols like
      other girls; but I afterwards found that I had been giving all my
      attention to the youngest, who was not <i>out</i>, and had most
      excessively offended the eldest. Miss Augusta ought not to have been
      noticed for the next six months; and Miss Sneyd, I believe, has never
      forgiven me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was bad indeed. Poor Miss Sneyd. Though I have no younger sister, I
      feel for her. To be neglected before one&rsquo;s time must be very vexatious;
      but it was entirely the mother&rsquo;s fault. Miss Augusta should have been with
      her governess. Such half-and-half doings never prosper. But now I must be
      satisfied about Miss Price. Does she go to balls? Does she dine out every
      where, as well as at my sister&rsquo;s?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Edmund; &ldquo;I do not think she has ever been to a ball. My
      mother seldom goes into company herself, and dines nowhere but with Mrs.
      Grant, and Fanny stays at home with <i>her</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! then the point is clear. Miss Price is not out.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mr. Bertram set off for&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;, and Miss Crawford was
      prepared to find a great chasm in their society, and to miss him decidedly
      in the meetings which were now becoming almost daily between the families;
      and on their all dining together at the Park soon after his going, she
      retook her chosen place near the bottom of the table, fully expecting to
      feel a most melancholy difference in the change of masters. It would be a
      very flat business, she was sure. In comparison with his brother, Edmund
      would have nothing to say. The soup would be sent round in a most
      spiritless manner, wine drank without any smiles or agreeable trifling,
      and the venison cut up without supplying one pleasant anecdote of any
      former haunch, or a single entertaining story, about &ldquo;my friend such a
      one.&rdquo; She must try to find amusement in what was passing at the upper end
      of the table, and in observing Mr. Rushworth, who was now making his
      appearance at Mansfield for the first time since the Crawfords&rsquo; arrival.
      He had been visiting a friend in the neighbouring county, and that friend
      having recently had his grounds laid out by an improver, Mr. Rushworth was
      returned with his head full of the subject, and very eager to be improving
      his own place in the same way; and though not saying much to the purpose,
      could talk of nothing else. The subject had been already handled in the
      drawing-room; it was revived in the dining-parlour. Miss Bertram&rsquo;s
      attention and opinion was evidently his chief aim; and though her
      deportment showed rather conscious superiority than any solicitude to
      oblige him, the mention of Sotherton Court, and the ideas attached to it,
      gave her a feeling of complacency, which prevented her from being very
      ungracious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish you could see Compton,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;it is the most complete thing! I
      never saw a place so altered in my life. I told Smith I did not know where
      I was. The approach <i>now</i>, is one of the finest things in the
      country: you see the house in the most surprising manner. I declare, when
      I got back to Sotherton yesterday, it looked like a prison&mdash;quite a
      dismal old prison.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, for shame!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Norris. &ldquo;A prison indeed? Sotherton Court is
      the noblest old place in the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It wants improvement, ma&rsquo;am, beyond anything. I never saw a place that
      wanted so much improvement in my life; and it is so forlorn that I do not
      know what can be done with it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No wonder that Mr. Rushworth should think so at present,&rdquo; said Mrs. Grant
      to Mrs. Norris, with a smile; &ldquo;but depend upon it, Sotherton will have <i>every</i>
      improvement in time which his heart can desire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must try to do something with it,&rdquo; said Mr. Rushworth, &ldquo;but I do not
      know what. I hope I shall have some good friend to help me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your best friend upon such an occasion,&rdquo; said Miss Bertram calmly, &ldquo;would
      be Mr. Repton, I imagine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is what I was thinking of. As he has done so well by Smith, I think
      I had better have him at once. His terms are five guineas a day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, and if they were <i>ten</i>,&rdquo; cried Mrs. Norris, &ldquo;I am sure <i>you</i>
      need not regard it. The expense need not be any impediment. If I were you,
      I should not think of the expense. I would have everything done in the
      best style, and made as nice as possible. Such a place as Sotherton Court
      deserves everything that taste and money can do. You have space to work
      upon there, and grounds that will well reward you. For my own part, if I
      had anything within the fiftieth part of the size of Sotherton, I should
      be always planting and improving, for naturally I am excessively fond of
      it. It would be too ridiculous for me to attempt anything where I am now,
      with my little half acre. It would be quite a burlesque. But if I had more
      room, I should take a prodigious delight in improving and planting. We did
      a vast deal in that way at the Parsonage: we made it quite a different
      place from what it was when we first had it. You young ones do not
      remember much about it, perhaps; but if dear Sir Thomas were here, he
      could tell you what improvements we made: and a great deal more would have
      been done, but for poor Mr. Norris&rsquo;s sad state of health. He could hardly
      ever get out, poor man, to enjoy anything, and <i>that</i> disheartened me
      from doing several things that Sir Thomas and I used to talk of. If it had
      not been for <i>that</i>, we should have carried on the garden wall, and
      made the plantation to shut out the churchyard, just as Dr. Grant has
      done. We were always doing something as it was. It was only the spring
      twelvemonth before Mr. Norris&rsquo;s death that we put in the apricot against
      the stable wall, which is now grown such a noble tree, and getting to such
      perfection, sir,&rdquo; addressing herself then to Dr. Grant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The tree thrives well, beyond a doubt, madam,&rdquo; replied Dr. Grant. &ldquo;The
      soil is good; and I never pass it without regretting that the fruit should
      be so little worth the trouble of gathering.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir, it is a Moor Park, we bought it as a Moor Park, and it cost us&mdash;that
      is, it was a present from Sir Thomas, but I saw the bill&mdash;and I know
      it cost seven shillings, and was charged as a Moor Park.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were imposed on, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; replied Dr. Grant: &ldquo;these potatoes have as
      much the flavour of a Moor Park apricot as the fruit from that tree. It is
      an insipid fruit at the best; but a good apricot is eatable, which none
      from my garden are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The truth is, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said Mrs. Grant, pretending to whisper across the
      table to Mrs. Norris, &ldquo;that Dr. Grant hardly knows what the natural taste
      of our apricot is: he is scarcely ever indulged with one, for it is so
      valuable a fruit; with a little assistance, and ours is such a remarkably
      large, fair sort, that what with early tarts and preserves, my cook
      contrives to get them all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Norris, who had begun to redden, was appeased; and, for a little
      while, other subjects took place of the improvements of Sotherton. Dr.
      Grant and Mrs. Norris were seldom good friends; their acquaintance had
      begun in dilapidations, and their habits were totally dissimilar.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a short interruption Mr. Rushworth began again. &ldquo;Smith&rsquo;s place is
      the admiration of all the country; and it was a mere nothing before Repton
      took it in hand. I think I shall have Repton.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Rushworth,&rdquo; said Lady Bertram, &ldquo;if I were you, I would have a very
      pretty shrubbery. One likes to get out into a shrubbery in fine weather.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Rushworth was eager to assure her ladyship of his acquiescence, and
      tried to make out something complimentary; but, between his submission to
      <i>her</i> taste, and his having always intended the same himself, with
      the superadded objects of professing attention to the comfort of ladies in
      general, and of insinuating that there was one only whom he was anxious to
      please, he grew puzzled, and Edmund was glad to put an end to his speech
      by a proposal of wine. Mr. Rushworth, however, though not usually a great
      talker, had still more to say on the subject next his heart. &ldquo;Smith has
      not much above a hundred acres altogether in his grounds, which is little
      enough, and makes it more surprising that the place can have been so
      improved. Now, at Sotherton we have a good seven hundred, without
      reckoning the water meadows; so that I think, if so much could be done at
      Compton, we need not despair. There have been two or three fine old trees
      cut down, that grew too near the house, and it opens the prospect
      amazingly, which makes me think that Repton, or anybody of that sort,
      would certainly have the avenue at Sotherton down: the avenue that leads
      from the west front to the top of the hill, you know,&rdquo; turning to Miss
      Bertram particularly as he spoke. But Miss Bertram thought it most
      becoming to reply&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The avenue! Oh! I do not recollect it. I really know very little of
      Sotherton.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fanny, who was sitting on the other side of Edmund, exactly opposite Miss
      Crawford, and who had been attentively listening, now looked at him, and
      said in a low voice&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cut down an avenue! What a pity! Does it not make you think of Cowper?
      &lsquo;Ye fallen avenues, once more I mourn your fate unmerited.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He smiled as he answered, &ldquo;I am afraid the avenue stands a bad chance,
      Fanny.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like to see Sotherton before it is cut down, to see the place as
      it is now, in its old state; but I do not suppose I shall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you never been there? No, you never can; and, unluckily, it is out
      of distance for a ride. I wish we could contrive it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! it does not signify. Whenever I do see it, you will tell me how it
      has been altered.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I collect,&rdquo; said Miss Crawford, &ldquo;that Sotherton is an old place, and a
      place of some grandeur. In any particular style of building?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The house was built in Elizabeth&rsquo;s time, and is a large, regular, brick
      building; heavy, but respectable looking, and has many good rooms. It is
      ill placed. It stands in one of the lowest spots of the park; in that
      respect, unfavourable for improvement. But the woods are fine, and there
      is a stream, which, I dare say, might be made a good deal of. Mr.
      Rushworth is quite right, I think, in meaning to give it a modern dress,
      and I have no doubt that it will be all done extremely well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Crawford listened with submission, and said to herself, &ldquo;He is a
      well-bred man; he makes the best of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not wish to influence Mr. Rushworth,&rdquo; he continued; &ldquo;but, had I a
      place to new fashion, I should not put myself into the hands of an
      improver. I would rather have an inferior degree of beauty, of my own
      choice, and acquired progressively. I would rather abide by my own
      blunders than by his.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>You</i> would know what you were about, of course; but that would not
      suit <i>me</i>. I have no eye or ingenuity for such matters, but as they
      are before me; and had I a place of my own in the country, I should be
      most thankful to any Mr. Repton who would undertake it, and give me as
      much beauty as he could for my money; and I should never look at it till
      it was complete.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be delightful to <i>me</i> to see the progress of it all,&rdquo; said
      Fanny.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, you have been brought up to it. It was no part of my education; and
      the only dose I ever had, being administered by not the first favourite in
      the world, has made me consider improvements <i>in</i> <i>hand</i> as the
      greatest of nuisances. Three years ago the Admiral, my honoured uncle,
      bought a cottage at Twickenham for us all to spend our summers in; and my
      aunt and I went down to it quite in raptures; but it being excessively
      pretty, it was soon found necessary to be improved, and for three months
      we were all dirt and confusion, without a gravel walk to step on, or a
      bench fit for use. I would have everything as complete as possible in the
      country, shrubberies and flower-gardens, and rustic seats innumerable: but
      it must all be done without my care. Henry is different; he loves to be
      doing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Edmund was sorry to hear Miss Crawford, whom he was much disposed to
      admire, speak so freely of her uncle. It did not suit his sense of
      propriety, and he was silenced, till induced by further smiles and
      liveliness to put the matter by for the present.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Bertram,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I have tidings of my harp at last. I am assured
      that it is safe at Northampton; and there it has probably been these ten
      days, in spite of the solemn assurances we have so often received to the
      contrary.&rdquo; Edmund expressed his pleasure and surprise. &ldquo;The truth is, that
      our inquiries were too direct; we sent a servant, we went ourselves: this
      will not do seventy miles from London; but this morning we heard of it in
      the right way. It was seen by some farmer, and he told the miller, and the
      miller told the butcher, and the butcher&rsquo;s son-in-law left word at the
      shop.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very glad that you have heard of it, by whatever means, and hope
      there will be no further delay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am to have it to-morrow; but how do you think it is to be conveyed? Not
      by a wagon or cart: oh no! nothing of that kind could be hired in the
      village. I might as well have asked for porters and a handbarrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would find it difficult, I dare say, just now, in the middle of a
      very late hay harvest, to hire a horse and cart?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was astonished to find what a piece of work was made of it! To want a
      horse and cart in the country seemed impossible, so I told my maid to
      speak for one directly; and as I cannot look out of my dressing-closet
      without seeing one farmyard, nor walk in the shrubbery without passing
      another, I thought it would be only ask and have, and was rather grieved
      that I could not give the advantage to all. Guess my surprise, when I
      found that I had been asking the most unreasonable, most impossible thing
      in the world; had offended all the farmers, all the labourers, all the hay
      in the parish! As for Dr. Grant&rsquo;s bailiff, I believe I had better keep out
      of <i>his</i> way; and my brother-in-law himself, who is all kindness in
      general, looked rather black upon me when he found what I had been at.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You could not be expected to have thought on the subject before; but when
      you <i>do</i> think of it, you must see the importance of getting in the
      grass. The hire of a cart at any time might not be so easy as you suppose:
      our farmers are not in the habit of letting them out; but, in harvest, it
      must be quite out of their power to spare a horse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall understand all your ways in time; but, coming down with the true
      London maxim, that everything is to be got with money, I was a little
      embarrassed at first by the sturdy independence of your country customs.
      However, I am to have my harp fetched to-morrow. Henry, who is good-nature
      itself, has offered to fetch it in his barouche. Will it not be honourably
      conveyed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Edmund spoke of the harp as his favourite instrument, and hoped to be soon
      allowed to hear her. Fanny had never heard the harp at all, and wished for
      it very much.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be most happy to play to you both,&rdquo; said Miss Crawford; &ldquo;at least
      as long as you can like to listen: probably much longer, for I dearly love
      music myself, and where the natural taste is equal the player must always
      be best off, for she is gratified in more ways than one. Now, Mr. Bertram,
      if you write to your brother, I entreat you to tell him that my harp is
      come: he heard so much of my misery about it. And you may say, if you
      please, that I shall prepare my most plaintive airs against his return, in
      compassion to his feelings, as I know his horse will lose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I write, I will say whatever you wish me; but I do not, at present,
      foresee any occasion for writing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I dare say, nor if he were to be gone a twelvemonth, would you ever
      write to him, nor he to you, if it could be helped. The occasion would
      never be foreseen. What strange creatures brothers are! You would not
      write to each other but upon the most urgent necessity in the world; and
      when obliged to take up the pen to say that such a horse is ill, or such a
      relation dead, it is done in the fewest possible words. You have but one
      style among you. I know it perfectly. Henry, who is in every other respect
      exactly what a brother should be, who loves me, consults me, confides in
      me, and will talk to me by the hour together, has never yet turned the
      page in a letter; and very often it is nothing more than&mdash;&lsquo;Dear Mary,
      I am just arrived. Bath seems full, and everything as usual. Yours
      sincerely.&rsquo; That is the true manly style; that is a complete brother&rsquo;s
      letter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When they are at a distance from all their family,&rdquo; said Fanny, colouring
      for William&rsquo;s sake, &ldquo;they can write long letters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Price has a brother at sea,&rdquo; said Edmund, &ldquo;whose excellence as a
      correspondent makes her think you too severe upon us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At sea, has she? In the king&rsquo;s service, of course?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fanny would rather have had Edmund tell the story, but his determined
      silence obliged her to relate her brother&rsquo;s situation: her voice was
      animated in speaking of his profession, and the foreign stations he had
      been on; but she could not mention the number of years that he had been
      absent without tears in her eyes. Miss Crawford civilly wished him an
      early promotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know anything of my cousin&rsquo;s captain?&rdquo; said Edmund; &ldquo;Captain
      Marshall? You have a large acquaintance in the navy, I conclude?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Among admirals, large enough; but,&rdquo; with an air of grandeur, &ldquo;we know
      very little of the inferior ranks. Post-captains may be very good sort of
      men, but they do not belong to <i>us</i>. Of various admirals I could tell
      you a great deal: of them and their flags, and the gradation of their pay,
      and their bickerings and jealousies. But, in general, I can assure you
      that they are all passed over, and all very ill used. Certainly, my home
      at my uncle&rsquo;s brought me acquainted with a circle of admirals. Of <i>Rears</i>
      and <i>Vices</i> I saw enough. Now do not be suspecting me of a pun, I
      entreat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Edmund again felt grave, and only replied, &ldquo;It is a noble profession.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, the profession is well enough under two circumstances: if it make
      the fortune, and there be discretion in spending it; but, in short, it is
      not a favourite profession of mine. It has never worn an amiable form to
      <i>me</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Edmund reverted to the harp, and was again very happy in the prospect of
      hearing her play.
    </p>
    <p>
      The subject of improving grounds, meanwhile, was still under consideration
      among the others; and Mrs. Grant could not help addressing her brother,
      though it was calling his attention from Miss Julia Bertram.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Henry, have <i>you</i> nothing to say? You have been an improver
      yourself, and from what I hear of Everingham, it may vie with any place in
      England. Its natural beauties, I am sure, are great. Everingham, as it <i>used</i>
      to be, was perfect in my estimation: such a happy fall of ground, and such
      timber! What would I not give to see it again?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing could be so gratifying to me as to hear your opinion of it,&rdquo; was
      his answer; &ldquo;but I fear there would be some disappointment: you would not
      find it equal to your present ideas. In extent, it is a mere nothing; you
      would be surprised at its insignificance; and, as for improvement, there
      was very little for me to do&mdash;too little: I should like to have been
      busy much longer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are fond of the sort of thing?&rdquo; said Julia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excessively; but what with the natural advantages of the ground, which
      pointed out, even to a very young eye, what little remained to be done,
      and my own consequent resolutions, I had not been of age three months
      before Everingham was all that it is now. My plan was laid at Westminster,
      a little altered, perhaps, at Cambridge, and at one-and-twenty executed. I
      am inclined to envy Mr. Rushworth for having so much happiness yet before
      him. I have been a devourer of my own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those who see quickly, will resolve quickly, and act quickly,&rdquo; said
      Julia. &ldquo;<i>You</i> can never want employment. Instead of envying Mr.
      Rushworth, you should assist him with your opinion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Grant, hearing the latter part of this speech, enforced it warmly,
      persuaded that no judgment could be equal to her brother&rsquo;s; and as Miss
      Bertram caught at the idea likewise, and gave it her full support,
      declaring that, in her opinion, it was infinitely better to consult with
      friends and disinterested advisers, than immediately to throw the business
      into the hands of a professional man, Mr. Rushworth was very ready to
      request the favour of Mr. Crawford&rsquo;s assistance; and Mr. Crawford, after
      properly depreciating his own abilities, was quite at his service in any
      way that could be useful. Mr. Rushworth then began to propose Mr.
      Crawford&rsquo;s doing him the honour of coming over to Sotherton, and taking a
      bed there; when Mrs. Norris, as if reading in her two nieces&rsquo; minds their
      little approbation of a plan which was to take Mr. Crawford away,
      interposed with an amendment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There can be no doubt of Mr. Crawford&rsquo;s willingness; but why should not
      more of us go? Why should not we make a little party? Here are many that
      would be interested in your improvements, my dear Mr. Rushworth, and that
      would like to hear Mr. Crawford&rsquo;s opinion on the spot, and that might be
      of some small use to you with <i>their</i> opinions; and, for my own part,
      I have been long wishing to wait upon your good mother again; nothing but
      having no horses of my own could have made me so remiss; but now I could
      go and sit a few hours with Mrs. Rushworth, while the rest of you walked
      about and settled things, and then we could all return to a late dinner
      here, or dine at Sotherton, just as might be most agreeable to your
      mother, and have a pleasant drive home by moonlight. I dare say Mr.
      Crawford would take my two nieces and me in his barouche, and Edmund can
      go on horseback, you know, sister, and Fanny will stay at home with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Bertram made no objection; and every one concerned in the going was
      forward in expressing their ready concurrence, excepting Edmund, who heard
      it all and said nothing.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Fanny, and how do you like Miss Crawford <i>now</i>?&rdquo; said Edmund
      the next day, after thinking some time on the subject himself. &ldquo;How did
      you like her yesterday?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well&mdash;very much. I like to hear her talk. She entertains me;
      and she is so extremely pretty, that I have great pleasure in looking at
      her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is her countenance that is so attractive. She has a wonderful play of
      feature! But was there nothing in her conversation that struck you, Fanny,
      as not quite right?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes! she ought not to have spoken of her uncle as she did. I was quite
      astonished. An uncle with whom she has been living so many years, and who,
      whatever his faults may be, is so very fond of her brother, treating him,
      they say, quite like a son. I could not have believed it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought you would be struck. It was very wrong; very indecorous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And very ungrateful, I think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ungrateful is a strong word. I do not know that her uncle has any claim
      to her <i>gratitude</i>; his wife certainly had; and it is the warmth of
      her respect for her aunt&rsquo;s memory which misleads her here. She is
      awkwardly circumstanced. With such warm feelings and lively spirits it
      must be difficult to do justice to her affection for Mrs. Crawford,
      without throwing a shade on the Admiral. I do not pretend to know which
      was most to blame in their disagreements, though the Admiral&rsquo;s present
      conduct might incline one to the side of his wife; but it is natural and
      amiable that Miss Crawford should acquit her aunt entirely. I do not
      censure her <i>opinions</i>; but there certainly <i>is</i> impropriety in
      making them public.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not you think,&rdquo; said Fanny, after a little consideration, &ldquo;that this
      impropriety is a reflection itself upon Mrs. Crawford, as her niece has
      been entirely brought up by her? She cannot have given her right notions
      of what was due to the Admiral.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is a fair remark. Yes, we must suppose the faults of the niece to
      have been those of the aunt; and it makes one more sensible of the
      disadvantages she has been under. But I think her present home must do her
      good. Mrs. Grant&rsquo;s manners are just what they ought to be. She speaks of
      her brother with a very pleasing affection.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, except as to his writing her such short letters. She made me almost
      laugh; but I cannot rate so very highly the love or good-nature of a
      brother who will not give himself the trouble of writing anything worth
      reading to his sisters, when they are separated. I am sure William would
      never have used <i>me</i> so, under any circumstances. And what right had
      she to suppose that <i>you</i> would not write long letters when you were
      absent?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The right of a lively mind, Fanny, seizing whatever may contribute to its
      own amusement or that of others; perfectly allowable, when untinctured by
      ill-humour or roughness; and there is not a shadow of either in the
      countenance or manner of Miss Crawford: nothing sharp, or loud, or coarse.
      She is perfectly feminine, except in the instances we have been speaking
      of. There she cannot be justified. I am glad you saw it all as I did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Having formed her mind and gained her affections, he had a good chance of
      her thinking like him; though at this period, and on this subject, there
      began now to be some danger of dissimilarity, for he was in a line of
      admiration of Miss Crawford, which might lead him where Fanny could not
      follow. Miss Crawford&rsquo;s attractions did not lessen. The harp arrived, and
      rather added to her beauty, wit, and good-humour; for she played with the
      greatest obligingness, with an expression and taste which were peculiarly
      becoming, and there was something clever to be said at the close of every
      air. Edmund was at the Parsonage every day, to be indulged with his
      favourite instrument: one morning secured an invitation for the next; for
      the lady could not be unwilling to have a listener, and every thing was
      soon in a fair train.
    </p>
    <p>
      A young woman, pretty, lively, with a harp as elegant as herself, and both
      placed near a window, cut down to the ground, and opening on a little
      lawn, surrounded by shrubs in the rich foliage of summer, was enough to
      catch any man&rsquo;s heart. The season, the scene, the air, were all favourable
      to tenderness and sentiment. Mrs. Grant and her tambour frame were not
      without their use: it was all in harmony; and as everything will turn to
      account when love is once set going, even the sandwich tray, and Dr. Grant
      doing the honours of it, were worth looking at. Without studying the
      business, however, or knowing what he was about, Edmund was beginning, at
      the end of a week of such intercourse, to be a good deal in love; and to
      the credit of the lady it may be added that, without his being a man of
      the world or an elder brother, without any of the arts of flattery or the
      gaieties of small talk, he began to be agreeable to her. She felt it to be
      so, though she had not foreseen, and could hardly understand it; for he
      was not pleasant by any common rule: he talked no nonsense; he paid no
      compliments; his opinions were unbending, his attentions tranquil and
      simple. There was a charm, perhaps, in his sincerity, his steadiness, his
      integrity, which Miss Crawford might be equal to feel, though not equal to
      discuss with herself. She did not think very much about it, however: he
      pleased her for the present; she liked to have him near her; it was
      enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fanny could not wonder that Edmund was at the Parsonage every morning; she
      would gladly have been there too, might she have gone in uninvited and
      unnoticed, to hear the harp; neither could she wonder that, when the
      evening stroll was over, and the two families parted again, he should
      think it right to attend Mrs. Grant and her sister to their home, while
      Mr. Crawford was devoted to the ladies of the Park; but she thought it a
      very bad exchange; and if Edmund were not there to mix the wine and water
      for her, would rather go without it than not. She was a little surprised
      that he could spend so many hours with Miss Crawford, and not see more of
      the sort of fault which he had already observed, and of which <i>she</i>
      was almost always reminded by a something of the same nature whenever she
      was in her company; but so it was. Edmund was fond of speaking to her of
      Miss Crawford, but he seemed to think it enough that the Admiral had since
      been spared; and she scrupled to point out her own remarks to him, lest it
      should appear like ill-nature. The first actual pain which Miss Crawford
      occasioned her was the consequence of an inclination to learn to ride,
      which the former caught, soon after her being settled at Mansfield, from
      the example of the young ladies at the Park, and which, when Edmund&rsquo;s
      acquaintance with her increased, led to his encouraging the wish, and the
      offer of his own quiet mare for the purpose of her first attempts, as the
      best fitted for a beginner that either stable could furnish. No pain, no
      injury, however, was designed by him to his cousin in this offer: <i>she</i>
      was not to lose a day&rsquo;s exercise by it. The mare was only to be taken down
      to the Parsonage half an hour before her ride were to begin; and Fanny, on
      its being first proposed, so far from feeling slighted, was almost
      over-powered with gratitude that he should be asking her leave for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Crawford made her first essay with great credit to herself, and no
      inconvenience to Fanny. Edmund, who had taken down the mare and presided
      at the whole, returned with it in excellent time, before either Fanny or
      the steady old coachman, who always attended her when she rode without her
      cousins, were ready to set forward. The second day&rsquo;s trial was not so
      guiltless. Miss Crawford&rsquo;s enjoyment of riding was such that she did not
      know how to leave off. Active and fearless, and though rather small,
      strongly made, she seemed formed for a horsewoman; and to the pure genuine
      pleasure of the exercise, something was probably added in Edmund&rsquo;s
      attendance and instructions, and something more in the conviction of very
      much surpassing her sex in general by her early progress, to make her
      unwilling to dismount. Fanny was ready and waiting, and Mrs. Norris was
      beginning to scold her for not being gone, and still no horse was
      announced, no Edmund appeared. To avoid her aunt, and look for him, she
      went out.
    </p>
    <p>
      The houses, though scarcely half a mile apart, were not within sight of
      each other; but, by walking fifty yards from the hall door, she could look
      down the park, and command a view of the Parsonage and all its demesnes,
      gently rising beyond the village road; and in Dr. Grant&rsquo;s meadow she
      immediately saw the group&mdash;Edmund and Miss Crawford both on
      horse-back, riding side by side, Dr. and Mrs. Grant, and Mr. Crawford,
      with two or three grooms, standing about and looking on. A happy party it
      appeared to her, all interested in one object: cheerful beyond a doubt,
      for the sound of merriment ascended even to her. It was a sound which did
      not make <i>her</i> cheerful; she wondered that Edmund should forget her,
      and felt a pang. She could not turn her eyes from the meadow; she could
      not help watching all that passed. At first Miss Crawford and her
      companion made the circuit of the field, which was not small, at a foot&rsquo;s
      pace; then, at <i>her</i> apparent suggestion, they rose into a canter;
      and to Fanny&rsquo;s timid nature it was most astonishing to see how well she
      sat. After a few minutes they stopped entirely. Edmund was close to her;
      he was speaking to her; he was evidently directing her management of the
      bridle; he had hold of her hand; she saw it, or the imagination supplied
      what the eye could not reach. She must not wonder at all this; what could
      be more natural than that Edmund should be making himself useful, and
      proving his good-nature by any one? She could not but think, indeed, that
      Mr. Crawford might as well have saved him the trouble; that it would have
      been particularly proper and becoming in a brother to have done it
      himself; but Mr. Crawford, with all his boasted good-nature, and all his
      coachmanship, probably knew nothing of the matter, and had no active
      kindness in comparison of Edmund. She began to think it rather hard upon
      the mare to have such double duty; if she were forgotten, the poor mare
      should be remembered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her feelings for one and the other were soon a little tranquillised by
      seeing the party in the meadow disperse, and Miss Crawford still on
      horseback, but attended by Edmund on foot, pass through a gate into the
      lane, and so into the park, and make towards the spot where she stood. She
      began then to be afraid of appearing rude and impatient; and walked to
      meet them with a great anxiety to avoid the suspicion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Miss Price,&rdquo; said Miss Crawford, as soon as she was at all within
      hearing, &ldquo;I am come to make my own apologies for keeping you waiting; but
      I have nothing in the world to say for myself&mdash;I knew it was very
      late, and that I was behaving extremely ill; and therefore, if you please,
      you must forgive me. Selfishness must always be forgiven, you know,
      because there is no hope of a cure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fanny&rsquo;s answer was extremely civil, and Edmund added his conviction that
      she could be in no hurry. &ldquo;For there is more than time enough for my
      cousin to ride twice as far as she ever goes,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and you have been
      promoting her comfort by preventing her from setting off half an hour
      sooner: clouds are now coming up, and she will not suffer from the heat as
      she would have done then. I wish <i>you</i> may not be fatigued by so much
      exercise. I wish you had saved yourself this walk home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No part of it fatigues me but getting off this horse, I assure you,&rdquo; said
      she, as she sprang down with his help; &ldquo;I am very strong. Nothing ever
      fatigues me but doing what I do not like. Miss Price, I give way to you
      with a very bad grace; but I sincerely hope you will have a pleasant ride,
      and that I may have nothing but good to hear of this dear, delightful,
      beautiful animal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old coachman, who had been waiting about with his own horse, now
      joining them, Fanny was lifted on hers, and they set off across another
      part of the park; her feelings of discomfort not lightened by seeing, as
      she looked back, that the others were walking down the hill together to
      the village; nor did her attendant do her much good by his comments on
      Miss Crawford&rsquo;s great cleverness as a horse-woman, which he had been
      watching with an interest almost equal to her own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a pleasure to see a lady with such a good heart for riding!&rdquo; said
      he. &ldquo;I never see one sit a horse better. She did not seem to have a
      thought of fear. Very different from you, miss, when you first began, six
      years ago come next Easter. Lord bless you! how you did tremble when Sir
      Thomas first had you put on!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the drawing-room Miss Crawford was also celebrated. Her merit in being
      gifted by Nature with strength and courage was fully appreciated by the
      Miss Bertrams; her delight in riding was like their own; her early
      excellence in it was like their own, and they had great pleasure in
      praising it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was sure she would ride well,&rdquo; said Julia; &ldquo;she has the make for it.
      Her figure is as neat as her brother&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; added Maria, &ldquo;and her spirits are as good, and she has the same
      energy of character. I cannot but think that good horsemanship has a great
      deal to do with the mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When they parted at night Edmund asked Fanny whether she meant to ride the
      next day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I do not know&mdash;not if you want the mare,&rdquo; was her answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not want her at all for myself,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;but whenever you are next
      inclined to stay at home, I think Miss Crawford would be glad to have her
      a longer time&mdash;for a whole morning, in short. She has a great desire
      to get as far as Mansfield Common: Mrs. Grant has been telling her of its
      fine views, and I have no doubt of her being perfectly equal to it. But
      any morning will do for this. She would be extremely sorry to interfere
      with you. It would be very wrong if she did. <i>She</i> rides only for
      pleasure; <i>you</i> for health.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall not ride to-morrow, certainly,&rdquo; said Fanny; &ldquo;I have been out very
      often lately, and would rather stay at home. You know I am strong enough
      now to walk very well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Edmund looked pleased, which must be Fanny&rsquo;s comfort, and the ride to
      Mansfield Common took place the next morning: the party included all the
      young people but herself, and was much enjoyed at the time, and doubly
      enjoyed again in the evening discussion. A successful scheme of this sort
      generally brings on another; and the having been to Mansfield Common
      disposed them all for going somewhere else the day after. There were many
      other views to be shewn; and though the weather was hot, there were shady
      lanes wherever they wanted to go. A young party is always provided with a
      shady lane. Four fine mornings successively were spent in this manner, in
      shewing the Crawfords the country, and doing the honours of its finest
      spots. Everything answered; it was all gaiety and good-humour, the heat
      only supplying inconvenience enough to be talked of with pleasure&mdash;till
      the fourth day, when the happiness of one of the party was exceedingly
      clouded. Miss Bertram was the one. Edmund and Julia were invited to dine
      at the Parsonage, and <i>she</i> was excluded. It was meant and done by
      Mrs. Grant, with perfect good-humour, on Mr. Rushworth&rsquo;s account, who was
      partly expected at the Park that day; but it was felt as a very grievous
      injury, and her good manners were severely taxed to conceal her vexation
      and anger till she reached home. As Mr. Rushworth did <i>not</i> come, the
      injury was increased, and she had not even the relief of shewing her power
      over him; she could only be sullen to her mother, aunt, and cousin, and
      throw as great a gloom as possible over their dinner and dessert.
    </p>
    <p>
      Between ten and eleven Edmund and Julia walked into the drawing-room,
      fresh with the evening air, glowing and cheerful, the very reverse of what
      they found in the three ladies sitting there, for Maria would scarcely
      raise her eyes from her book, and Lady Bertram was half-asleep; and even
      Mrs. Norris, discomposed by her niece&rsquo;s ill-humour, and having asked one
      or two questions about the dinner, which were not immediately attended to,
      seemed almost determined to say no more. For a few minutes the brother and
      sister were too eager in their praise of the night and their remarks on
      the stars, to think beyond themselves; but when the first pause came,
      Edmund, looking around, said, &ldquo;But where is Fanny? Is she gone to bed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not that I know of,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Norris; &ldquo;she was here a moment
      ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her own gentle voice speaking from the other end of the room, which was a
      very long one, told them that she was on the sofa. Mrs. Norris began
      scolding.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is a very foolish trick, Fanny, to be idling away all the evening
      upon a sofa. Why cannot you come and sit here, and employ yourself as <i>we</i>
      do? If you have no work of your own, I can supply you from the poor
      basket. There is all the new calico, that was bought last week, not
      touched yet. I am sure I almost broke my back by cutting it out. You
      should learn to think of other people; and, take my word for it, it is a
      shocking trick for a young person to be always lolling upon a sofa.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before half this was said, Fanny was returned to her seat at the table,
      and had taken up her work again; and Julia, who was in high good-humour,
      from the pleasures of the day, did her the justice of exclaiming, &ldquo;I must
      say, ma&rsquo;am, that Fanny is as little upon the sofa as anybody in the
      house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fanny,&rdquo; said Edmund, after looking at her attentively, &ldquo;I am sure you
      have the headache.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She could not deny it, but said it was not very bad.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can hardly believe you,&rdquo; he replied; &ldquo;I know your looks too well. How
      long have you had it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since a little before dinner. It is nothing but the heat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you go out in the heat?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go out! to be sure she did,&rdquo; said Mrs. Norris: &ldquo;would you have her stay
      within such a fine day as this? Were not we <i>all</i> out? Even your
      mother was out to-day for above an hour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, indeed, Edmund,&rdquo; added her ladyship, who had been thoroughly
      awakened by Mrs. Norris&rsquo;s sharp reprimand to Fanny; &ldquo;I was out above an
      hour. I sat three-quarters of an hour in the flower-garden, while Fanny
      cut the roses; and very pleasant it was, I assure you, but very hot. It
      was shady enough in the alcove, but I declare I quite dreaded the coming
      home again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fanny has been cutting roses, has she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and I am afraid they will be the last this year. Poor thing! <i>She</i>
      found it hot enough; but they were so full-blown that one could not wait.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was no help for it, certainly,&rdquo; rejoined Mrs. Norris, in a rather
      softened voice; &ldquo;but I question whether her headache might not be caught
      <i>then</i>, sister. There is nothing so likely to give it as standing and
      stooping in a hot sun; but I dare say it will be well to-morrow. Suppose
      you let her have your aromatic vinegar; I always forget to have mine
      filled.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has got it,&rdquo; said Lady Bertram; &ldquo;she has had it ever since she came
      back from your house the second time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; cried Edmund; &ldquo;has she been walking as well as cutting roses;
      walking across the hot park to your house, and doing it twice, ma&rsquo;am? No
      wonder her head aches.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Norris was talking to Julia, and did not hear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was afraid it would be too much for her,&rdquo; said Lady Bertram; &ldquo;but when
      the roses were gathered, your aunt wished to have them, and then you know
      they must be taken home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But were there roses enough to oblige her to go twice?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; but they were to be put into the spare room to dry; and, unluckily,
      Fanny forgot to lock the door of the room and bring away the key, so she
      was obliged to go again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Edmund got up and walked about the room, saying, &ldquo;And could nobody be
      employed on such an errand but Fanny? Upon my word, ma&rsquo;am, it has been a
      very ill-managed business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure I do not know how it was to have been done better,&rdquo; cried Mrs.
      Norris, unable to be longer deaf; &ldquo;unless I had gone myself, indeed; but I
      cannot be in two places at once; and I was talking to Mr. Green at that
      very time about your mother&rsquo;s dairymaid, by <i>her</i> desire, and had
      promised John Groom to write to Mrs. Jefferies about his son, and the poor
      fellow was waiting for me half an hour. I think nobody can justly accuse
      me of sparing myself upon any occasion, but really I cannot do everything
      at once. And as for Fanny&rsquo;s just stepping down to my house for me&mdash;it
      is not much above a quarter of a mile&mdash;I cannot think I was
      unreasonable to ask it. How often do I pace it three times a day, early
      and late, ay, and in all weathers too, and say nothing about it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish Fanny had half your strength, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If Fanny would be more regular in her exercise, she would not be knocked
      up so soon. She has not been out on horseback now this long while, and I
      am persuaded that, when she does not ride, she ought to walk. If she had
      been riding before, I should not have asked it of her. But I thought it
      would rather do her good after being stooping among the roses; for there
      is nothing so refreshing as a walk after a fatigue of that kind; and
      though the sun was strong, it was not so very hot. Between ourselves,
      Edmund,&rdquo; nodding significantly at his mother, &ldquo;it was cutting the roses,
      and dawdling about in the flower-garden, that did the mischief.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid it was, indeed,&rdquo; said the more candid Lady Bertram, who had
      overheard her; &ldquo;I am very much afraid she caught the headache there, for
      the heat was enough to kill anybody. It was as much as I could bear
      myself. Sitting and calling to Pug, and trying to keep him from the
      flower-beds, was almost too much for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Edmund said no more to either lady; but going quietly to another table, on
      which the supper-tray yet remained, brought a glass of Madeira to Fanny,
      and obliged her to drink the greater part. She wished to be able to
      decline it; but the tears, which a variety of feelings created, made it
      easier to swallow than to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vexed as Edmund was with his mother and aunt, he was still more angry with
      himself. His own forgetfulness of her was worse than anything which they
      had done. Nothing of this would have happened had she been properly
      considered; but she had been left four days together without any choice of
      companions or exercise, and without any excuse for avoiding whatever her
      unreasonable aunts might require. He was ashamed to think that for four
      days together she had not had the power of riding, and very seriously
      resolved, however unwilling he must be to check a pleasure of Miss
      Crawford&rsquo;s, that it should never happen again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fanny went to bed with her heart as full as on the first evening of her
      arrival at the Park. The state of her spirits had probably had its share
      in her indisposition; for she had been feeling neglected, and been
      struggling against discontent and envy for some days past. As she leant on
      the sofa, to which she had retreated that she might not be seen, the pain
      of her mind had been much beyond that in her head; and the sudden change
      which Edmund&rsquo;s kindness had then occasioned, made her hardly know how to
      support herself.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Fanny&rsquo;s rides recommenced the very next day; and as it was a pleasant
      fresh-feeling morning, less hot than the weather had lately been, Edmund
      trusted that her losses, both of health and pleasure, would be soon made
      good. While she was gone Mr. Rushworth arrived, escorting his mother, who
      came to be civil and to shew her civility especially, in urging the
      execution of the plan for visiting Sotherton, which had been started a
      fortnight before, and which, in consequence of her subsequent absence from
      home, had since lain dormant. Mrs. Norris and her nieces were all well
      pleased with its revival, and an early day was named and agreed to,
      provided Mr. Crawford should be disengaged: the young ladies did not
      forget that stipulation, and though Mrs. Norris would willingly have
      answered for his being so, they would neither authorise the liberty nor
      run the risk; and at last, on a hint from Miss Bertram, Mr. Rushworth
      discovered that the properest thing to be done was for him to walk down to
      the Parsonage directly, and call on Mr. Crawford, and inquire whether
      Wednesday would suit him or not.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before his return Mrs. Grant and Miss Crawford came in. Having been out
      some time, and taken a different route to the house, they had not met him.
      Comfortable hopes, however, were given that he would find Mr. Crawford at
      home. The Sotherton scheme was mentioned of course. It was hardly
      possible, indeed, that anything else should be talked of, for Mrs. Norris
      was in high spirits about it; and Mrs. Rushworth, a well-meaning, civil,
      prosing, pompous woman, who thought nothing of consequence, but as it
      related to her own and her son&rsquo;s concerns, had not yet given over pressing
      Lady Bertram to be of the party. Lady Bertram constantly declined it; but
      her placid manner of refusal made Mrs. Rushworth still think she wished to
      come, till Mrs. Norris&rsquo;s more numerous words and louder tone convinced her
      of the truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fatigue would be too much for my sister, a great deal too much, I
      assure you, my dear Mrs. Rushworth. Ten miles there, and ten back, you
      know. You must excuse my sister on this occasion, and accept of our two
      dear girls and myself without her. Sotherton is the only place that could
      give her a <i>wish</i> to go so far, but it cannot be, indeed. She will
      have a companion in Fanny Price, you know, so it will all do very well;
      and as for Edmund, as he is not here to speak for himself, I will answer
      for his being most happy to join the party. He can go on horseback, you
      know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Rushworth being obliged to yield to Lady Bertram&rsquo;s staying at home,
      could only be sorry. &ldquo;The loss of her ladyship&rsquo;s company would be a great
      drawback, and she should have been extremely happy to have seen the young
      lady too, Miss Price, who had never been at Sotherton yet, and it was a
      pity she should not see the place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very kind, you are all kindness, my dear madam,&rdquo; cried Mrs.
      Norris; &ldquo;but as to Fanny, she will have opportunities in plenty of seeing
      Sotherton. She has time enough before her; and her going now is quite out
      of the question. Lady Bertram could not possibly spare her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh no! I cannot do without Fanny.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Rushworth proceeded next, under the conviction that everybody must be
      wanting to see Sotherton, to include Miss Crawford in the invitation; and
      though Mrs. Grant, who had not been at the trouble of visiting Mrs.
      Rushworth, on her coming into the neighbourhood, civilly declined it on
      her own account, she was glad to secure any pleasure for her sister; and
      Mary, properly pressed and persuaded, was not long in accepting her share
      of the civility. Mr. Rushworth came back from the Parsonage successful;
      and Edmund made his appearance just in time to learn what had been settled
      for Wednesday, to attend Mrs. Rushworth to her carriage, and walk half-way
      down the park with the two other ladies.
    </p>
    <p>
      On his return to the breakfast-room, he found Mrs. Norris trying to make
      up her mind as to whether Miss Crawford&rsquo;s being of the party were
      desirable or not, or whether her brother&rsquo;s barouche would not be full
      without her. The Miss Bertrams laughed at the idea, assuring her that the
      barouche would hold four perfectly well, independent of the box, on which
      <i>one</i> might go with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why is it necessary,&rdquo; said Edmund, &ldquo;that Crawford&rsquo;s carriage, or his
      <i>only</i>, should be employed? Why is no use to be made of my mother&rsquo;s
      chaise? I could not, when the scheme was first mentioned the other day,
      understand why a visit from the family were not to be made in the carriage
      of the family.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; cried Julia: &ldquo;go boxed up three in a postchaise in this weather,
      when we may have seats in a barouche! No, my dear Edmund, that will not
      quite do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; said Maria, &ldquo;I know that Mr. Crawford depends upon taking us.
      After what passed at first, he would claim it as a promise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And, my dear Edmund,&rdquo; added Mrs. Norris, &ldquo;taking out <i>two</i> carriages
      when <i>one</i> will do, would be trouble for nothing; and, between
      ourselves, coachman is not very fond of the roads between this and
      Sotherton: he always complains bitterly of the narrow lanes scratching his
      carriage, and you know one should not like to have dear Sir Thomas, when
      he comes home, find all the varnish scratched off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That would not be a very handsome reason for using Mr. Crawford&rsquo;s,&rdquo; said
      Maria; &ldquo;but the truth is, that Wilcox is a stupid old fellow, and does not
      know how to drive. I will answer for it that we shall find no
      inconvenience from narrow roads on Wednesday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no hardship, I suppose, nothing unpleasant,&rdquo; said Edmund, &ldquo;in
      going on the barouche box.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unpleasant!&rdquo; cried Maria: &ldquo;oh dear! I believe it would be generally
      thought the favourite seat. There can be no comparison as to one&rsquo;s view of
      the country. Probably Miss Crawford will choose the barouche-box herself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There can be no objection, then, to Fanny&rsquo;s going with you; there can be
      no doubt of your having room for her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fanny!&rdquo; repeated Mrs. Norris; &ldquo;my dear Edmund, there is no idea of her
      going with us. She stays with her aunt. I told Mrs. Rushworth so. She is
      not expected.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can have no reason, I imagine, madam,&rdquo; said he, addressing his
      mother, &ldquo;for wishing Fanny <i>not</i> to be of the party, but as it
      relates to yourself, to your own comfort. If you could do without her, you
      would not wish to keep her at home?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be sure not, but I <i>cannot</i> do without her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can, if I stay at home with you, as I mean to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a general cry out at this. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;there is no
      necessity for my going, and I mean to stay at home. Fanny has a great
      desire to see Sotherton. I know she wishes it very much. She has not often
      a gratification of the kind, and I am sure, ma&rsquo;am, you would be glad to
      give her the pleasure now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes! very glad, if your aunt sees no objection.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Norris was very ready with the only objection which could remain&mdash;their
      having positively assured Mrs. Rushworth that Fanny could not go, and the
      very strange appearance there would consequently be in taking her, which
      seemed to her a difficulty quite impossible to be got over. It must have
      the strangest appearance! It would be something so very unceremonious, so
      bordering on disrespect for Mrs. Rushworth, whose own manners were such a
      pattern of good-breeding and attention, that she really did not feel equal
      to it. Mrs. Norris had no affection for Fanny, and no wish of procuring
      her pleasure at any time; but her opposition to Edmund <i>now</i>, arose
      more from partiality for her own scheme, because it <i>was</i> her own,
      than from anything else. She felt that she had arranged everything
      extremely well, and that any alteration must be for the worse. When
      Edmund, therefore, told her in reply, as he did when she would give him
      the hearing, that she need not distress herself on Mrs. Rushworth&rsquo;s
      account, because he had taken the opportunity, as he walked with her
      through the hall, of mentioning Miss Price as one who would probably be of
      the party, and had directly received a very sufficient invitation for his
      cousin, Mrs. Norris was too much vexed to submit with a very good grace,
      and would only say, &ldquo;Very well, very well, just as you chuse, settle it
      your own way, I am sure I do not care about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems very odd,&rdquo; said Maria, &ldquo;that you should be staying at home
      instead of Fanny.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure she ought to be very much obliged to you,&rdquo; added Julia, hastily
      leaving the room as she spoke, from a consciousness that she ought to
      offer to stay at home herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fanny will feel quite as grateful as the occasion requires,&rdquo; was Edmund&rsquo;s
      only reply, and the subject dropt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fanny&rsquo;s gratitude, when she heard the plan, was, in fact, much greater
      than her pleasure. She felt Edmund&rsquo;s kindness with all, and more than all,
      the sensibility which he, unsuspicious of her fond attachment, could be
      aware of; but that he should forego any enjoyment on her account gave her
      pain, and her own satisfaction in seeing Sotherton would be nothing
      without him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next meeting of the two Mansfield families produced another alteration
      in the plan, and one that was admitted with general approbation. Mrs.
      Grant offered herself as companion for the day to Lady Bertram in lieu of
      her son, and Dr. Grant was to join them at dinner. Lady Bertram was very
      well pleased to have it so, and the young ladies were in spirits again.
      Even Edmund was very thankful for an arrangement which restored him to his
      share of the party; and Mrs. Norris thought it an excellent plan, and had
      it at her tongue&rsquo;s end, and was on the point of proposing it, when Mrs.
      Grant spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wednesday was fine, and soon after breakfast the barouche arrived, Mr.
      Crawford driving his sisters; and as everybody was ready, there was
      nothing to be done but for Mrs. Grant to alight and the others to take
      their places. The place of all places, the envied seat, the post of
      honour, was unappropriated. To whose happy lot was it to fall? While each
      of the Miss Bertrams were meditating how best, and with the most
      appearance of obliging the others, to secure it, the matter was settled by
      Mrs. Grant&rsquo;s saying, as she stepped from the carriage, &ldquo;As there are five
      of you, it will be better that one should sit with Henry; and as you were
      saying lately that you wished you could drive, Julia, I think this will be
      a good opportunity for you to take a lesson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Happy Julia! Unhappy Maria! The former was on the barouche-box in a
      moment, the latter took her seat within, in gloom and mortification; and
      the carriage drove off amid the good wishes of the two remaining ladies,
      and the barking of Pug in his mistress&rsquo;s arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their road was through a pleasant country; and Fanny, whose rides had
      never been extensive, was soon beyond her knowledge, and was very happy in
      observing all that was new, and admiring all that was pretty. She was not
      often invited to join in the conversation of the others, nor did she
      desire it. Her own thoughts and reflections were habitually her best
      companions; and, in observing the appearance of the country, the bearings
      of the roads, the difference of soil, the state of the harvest, the
      cottages, the cattle, the children, she found entertainment that could
      only have been heightened by having Edmund to speak to of what she felt.
      That was the only point of resemblance between her and the lady who sat by
      her: in everything but a value for Edmund, Miss Crawford was very unlike
      her. She had none of Fanny&rsquo;s delicacy of taste, of mind, of feeling; she
      saw Nature, inanimate Nature, with little observation; her attention was
      all for men and women, her talents for the light and lively. In looking
      back after Edmund, however, when there was any stretch of road behind
      them, or when he gained on them in ascending a considerable hill, they
      were united, and a &ldquo;there he is&rdquo; broke at the same moment from them both,
      more than once.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the first seven miles Miss Bertram had very little real comfort: her
      prospect always ended in Mr. Crawford and her sister sitting side by side,
      full of conversation and merriment; and to see only his expressive profile
      as he turned with a smile to Julia, or to catch the laugh of the other,
      was a perpetual source of irritation, which her own sense of propriety
      could but just smooth over. When Julia looked back, it was with a
      countenance of delight, and whenever she spoke to them, it was in the
      highest spirits: &ldquo;her view of the country was charming, she wished they
      could all see it,&rdquo; etc.; but her only offer of exchange was addressed to
      Miss Crawford, as they gained the summit of a long hill, and was not more
      inviting than this: &ldquo;Here is a fine burst of country. I wish you had my
      seat, but I dare say you will not take it, let me press you ever so much;&rdquo;
       and Miss Crawford could hardly answer before they were moving again at a
      good pace.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they came within the influence of Sotherton associations, it was
      better for Miss Bertram, who might be said to have two strings to her bow.
      She had Rushworth feelings, and Crawford feelings, and in the vicinity of
      Sotherton the former had considerable effect. Mr. Rushworth&rsquo;s consequence
      was hers. She could not tell Miss Crawford that &ldquo;those woods belonged to
      Sotherton,&rdquo; she could not carelessly observe that &ldquo;she believed that it
      was now all Mr. Rushworth&rsquo;s property on each side of the road,&rdquo; without
      elation of heart; and it was a pleasure to increase with their approach to
      the capital freehold mansion, and ancient manorial residence of the
      family, with all its rights of court-leet and court-baron.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now we shall have no more rough road, Miss Crawford; our difficulties are
      over. The rest of the way is such as it ought to be. Mr. Rushworth has
      made it since he succeeded to the estate. Here begins the village. Those
      cottages are really a disgrace. The church spire is reckoned remarkably
      handsome. I am glad the church is not so close to the great house as often
      happens in old places. The annoyance of the bells must be terrible. There
      is the parsonage: a tidy-looking house, and I understand the clergyman and
      his wife are very decent people. Those are almshouses, built by some of
      the family. To the right is the steward&rsquo;s house; he is a very respectable
      man. Now we are coming to the lodge-gates; but we have nearly a mile
      through the park still. It is not ugly, you see, at this end; there is
      some fine timber, but the situation of the house is dreadful. We go down
      hill to it for half a mile, and it is a pity, for it would not be an
      ill-looking place if it had a better approach.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Crawford was not slow to admire; she pretty well guessed Miss
      Bertram&rsquo;s feelings, and made it a point of honour to promote her enjoyment
      to the utmost. Mrs. Norris was all delight and volubility; and even Fanny
      had something to say in admiration, and might be heard with complacency.
      Her eye was eagerly taking in everything within her reach; and after being
      at some pains to get a view of the house, and observing that &ldquo;it was a
      sort of building which she could not look at but with respect,&rdquo; she added,
      &ldquo;Now, where is the avenue? The house fronts the east, I perceive. The
      avenue, therefore, must be at the back of it. Mr. Rushworth talked of the
      west front.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it is exactly behind the house; begins at a little distance, and
      ascends for half a mile to the extremity of the grounds. You may see
      something of it here&mdash;something of the more distant trees. It is oak
      entirely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Bertram could now speak with decided information of what she had
      known nothing about when Mr. Rushworth had asked her opinion; and her
      spirits were in as happy a flutter as vanity and pride could furnish, when
      they drove up to the spacious stone steps before the principal entrance.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IX
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mr. Rushworth was at the door to receive his fair lady; and the whole
      party were welcomed by him with due attention. In the drawing-room they
      were met with equal cordiality by the mother, and Miss Bertram had all the
      distinction with each that she could wish. After the business of arriving
      was over, it was first necessary to eat, and the doors were thrown open to
      admit them through one or two intermediate rooms into the appointed
      dining-parlour, where a collation was prepared with abundance and
      elegance. Much was said, and much was ate, and all went well. The
      particular object of the day was then considered. How would Mr. Crawford
      like, in what manner would he chuse, to take a survey of the grounds? Mr.
      Rushworth mentioned his curricle. Mr. Crawford suggested the greater
      desirableness of some carriage which might convey more than two. &ldquo;To be
      depriving themselves of the advantage of other eyes and other judgments,
      might be an evil even beyond the loss of present pleasure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Rushworth proposed that the chaise should be taken also; but this was
      scarcely received as an amendment: the young ladies neither smiled nor
      spoke. Her next proposition, of shewing the house to such of them as had
      not been there before, was more acceptable, for Miss Bertram was pleased
      to have its size displayed, and all were glad to be doing something.
    </p>
    <p>
      The whole party rose accordingly, and under Mrs. Rushworth&rsquo;s guidance were
      shewn through a number of rooms, all lofty, and many large, and amply
      furnished in the taste of fifty years back, with shining floors, solid
      mahogany, rich damask, marble, gilding, and carving, each handsome in its
      way. Of pictures there were abundance, and some few good, but the larger
      part were family portraits, no longer anything to anybody but Mrs.
      Rushworth, who had been at great pains to learn all that the housekeeper
      could teach, and was now almost equally well qualified to shew the house.
      On the present occasion she addressed herself chiefly to Miss Crawford and
      Fanny, but there was no comparison in the willingness of their attention;
      for Miss Crawford, who had seen scores of great houses, and cared for none
      of them, had only the appearance of civilly listening, while Fanny, to
      whom everything was almost as interesting as it was new, attended with
      unaffected earnestness to all that Mrs. Rushworth could relate of the
      family in former times, its rise and grandeur, regal visits and loyal
      efforts, delighted to connect anything with history already known, or warm
      her imagination with scenes of the past.
    </p>
    <p>
      The situation of the house excluded the possibility of much prospect from
      any of the rooms; and while Fanny and some of the others were attending
      Mrs. Rushworth, Henry Crawford was looking grave and shaking his head at
      the windows. Every room on the west front looked across a lawn to the
      beginning of the avenue immediately beyond tall iron palisades and gates.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having visited many more rooms than could be supposed to be of any other
      use than to contribute to the window-tax, and find employment for
      housemaids, &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Mrs. Rushworth, &ldquo;we are coming to the chapel,
      which properly we ought to enter from above, and look down upon; but as we
      are quite among friends, I will take you in this way, if you will excuse
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They entered. Fanny&rsquo;s imagination had prepared her for something grander
      than a mere spacious, oblong room, fitted up for the purpose of devotion:
      with nothing more striking or more solemn than the profusion of mahogany,
      and the crimson velvet cushions appearing over the ledge of the family
      gallery above. &ldquo;I am disappointed,&rdquo; said she, in a low voice, to Edmund.
      &ldquo;This is not my idea of a chapel. There is nothing awful here, nothing
      melancholy, nothing grand. Here are no aisles, no arches, no inscriptions,
      no banners. No banners, cousin, to be &lsquo;blown by the night wind of heaven.&rsquo; 
      No signs that a &lsquo;Scottish monarch sleeps below.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You forget, Fanny, how lately all this has been built, and for how
      confined a purpose, compared with the old chapels of castles and
      monasteries. It was only for the private use of the family. They have been
      buried, I suppose, in the parish church. <i>There</i> you must look for
      the banners and the achievements.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was foolish of me not to think of all that; but I am disappointed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Rushworth began her relation. &ldquo;This chapel was fitted up as you see
      it, in James the Second&rsquo;s time. Before that period, as I understand, the
      pews were only wainscot; and there is some reason to think that the
      linings and cushions of the pulpit and family seat were only purple cloth;
      but this is not quite certain. It is a handsome chapel, and was formerly
      in constant use both morning and evening. Prayers were always read in it
      by the domestic chaplain, within the memory of many; but the late Mr.
      Rushworth left it off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every generation has its improvements,&rdquo; said Miss Crawford, with a smile,
      to Edmund.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Rushworth was gone to repeat her lesson to Mr. Crawford; and Edmund,
      Fanny, and Miss Crawford remained in a cluster together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a pity,&rdquo; cried Fanny, &ldquo;that the custom should have been
      discontinued. It was a valuable part of former times. There is something
      in a chapel and chaplain so much in character with a great house, with
      one&rsquo;s ideas of what such a household should be! A whole family assembling
      regularly for the purpose of prayer is fine!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very fine indeed,&rdquo; said Miss Crawford, laughing. &ldquo;It must do the heads of
      the family a great deal of good to force all the poor housemaids and
      footmen to leave business and pleasure, and say their prayers here twice a
      day, while they are inventing excuses themselves for staying away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>That</i> is hardly Fanny&rsquo;s idea of a family assembling,&rdquo; said Edmund.
      &ldquo;If the master and mistress do <i>not</i> attend themselves, there must be
      more harm than good in the custom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At any rate, it is safer to leave people to their own devices on such
      subjects. Everybody likes to go their own way&mdash;to chuse their own
      time and manner of devotion. The obligation of attendance, the formality,
      the restraint, the length of time&mdash;altogether it is a formidable
      thing, and what nobody likes; and if the good people who used to kneel and
      gape in that gallery could have foreseen that the time would ever come
      when men and women might lie another ten minutes in bed, when they woke
      with a headache, without danger of reprobation, because chapel was missed,
      they would have jumped with joy and envy. Cannot you imagine with what
      unwilling feelings the former belles of the house of Rushworth did many a
      time repair to this chapel? The young Mrs. Eleanors and Mrs. Bridgets&mdash;starched
      up into seeming piety, but with heads full of something very different&mdash;especially
      if the poor chaplain were not worth looking at&mdash;and, in those days, I
      fancy parsons were very inferior even to what they are now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a few moments she was unanswered. Fanny coloured and looked at Edmund,
      but felt too angry for speech; and he needed a little recollection before
      he could say, &ldquo;Your lively mind can hardly be serious even on serious
      subjects. You have given us an amusing sketch, and human nature cannot say
      it was not so. We must all feel <i>at</i> <i>times</i> the difficulty of
      fixing our thoughts as we could wish; but if you are supposing it a
      frequent thing, that is to say, a weakness grown into a habit from
      neglect, what could be expected from the <i>private</i> devotions of such
      persons? Do you think the minds which are suffered, which are indulged in
      wanderings in a chapel, would be more collected in a closet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, very likely. They would have two chances at least in their favour.
      There would be less to distract the attention from without, and it would
      not be tried so long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The mind which does not struggle against itself under <i>one</i>
      circumstance, would find objects to distract it in the <i>other</i>, I
      believe; and the influence of the place and of example may often rouse
      better feelings than are begun with. The greater length of the service,
      however, I admit to be sometimes too hard a stretch upon the mind. One
      wishes it were not so; but I have not yet left Oxford long enough to
      forget what chapel prayers are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While this was passing, the rest of the party being scattered about the
      chapel, Julia called Mr. Crawford&rsquo;s attention to her sister, by saying,
      &ldquo;Do look at Mr. Rushworth and Maria, standing side by side, exactly as if
      the ceremony were going to be performed. Have not they completely the air
      of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Crawford smiled his acquiescence, and stepping forward to Maria, said,
      in a voice which she only could hear, &ldquo;I do not like to see Miss Bertram
      so near the altar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Starting, the lady instinctively moved a step or two, but recovering
      herself in a moment, affected to laugh, and asked him, in a tone not much
      louder, &ldquo;If he would give her away?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid I should do it very awkwardly,&rdquo; was his reply, with a look of
      meaning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Julia, joining them at the moment, carried on the joke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon my word, it is really a pity that it should not take place directly,
      if we had but a proper licence, for here we are altogether, and nothing in
      the world could be more snug and pleasant.&rdquo; And she talked and laughed
      about it with so little caution as to catch the comprehension of Mr.
      Rushworth and his mother, and expose her sister to the whispered
      gallantries of her lover, while Mrs. Rushworth spoke with proper smiles
      and dignity of its being a most happy event to her whenever it took place.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If Edmund were but in orders!&rdquo; cried Julia, and running to where he stood
      with Miss Crawford and Fanny: &ldquo;My dear Edmund, if you were but in orders
      now, you might perform the ceremony directly. How unlucky that you are not
      ordained; Mr. Rushworth and Maria are quite ready.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Crawford&rsquo;s countenance, as Julia spoke, might have amused a
      disinterested observer. She looked almost aghast under the new idea she
      was receiving. Fanny pitied her. &ldquo;How distressed she will be at what she
      said just now,&rdquo; passed across her mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ordained!&rdquo; said Miss Crawford; &ldquo;what, are you to be a clergyman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I shall take orders soon after my father&rsquo;s return&mdash;probably at
      Christmas.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Crawford, rallying her spirits, and recovering her complexion,
      replied only, &ldquo;If I had known this before, I would have spoken of the
      cloth with more respect,&rdquo; and turned the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      The chapel was soon afterwards left to the silence and stillness which
      reigned in it, with few interruptions, throughout the year. Miss Bertram,
      displeased with her sister, led the way, and all seemed to feel that they
      had been there long enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lower part of the house had been now entirely shewn, and Mrs.
      Rushworth, never weary in the cause, would have proceeded towards the
      principal staircase, and taken them through all the rooms above, if her
      son had not interposed with a doubt of there being time enough. &ldquo;For if,&rdquo;
       said he, with the sort of self-evident proposition which many a clearer
      head does not always avoid, &ldquo;we are <i>too</i> long going over the house,
      we shall not have time for what is to be done out of doors. It is past
      two, and we are to dine at five.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Rushworth submitted; and the question of surveying the grounds, with
      the who and the how, was likely to be more fully agitated, and Mrs. Norris
      was beginning to arrange by what junction of carriages and horses most
      could be done, when the young people, meeting with an outward door,
      temptingly open on a flight of steps which led immediately to turf and
      shrubs, and all the sweets of pleasure-grounds, as by one impulse, one
      wish for air and liberty, all walked out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose we turn down here for the present,&rdquo; said Mrs. Rushworth, civilly
      taking the hint and following them. &ldquo;Here are the greatest number of our
      plants, and here are the curious pheasants.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Query,&rdquo; said Mr. Crawford, looking round him, &ldquo;whether we may not find
      something to employ us here before we go farther? I see walls of great
      promise. Mr. Rushworth, shall we summon a council on this lawn?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;James,&rdquo; said Mrs. Rushworth to her son, &ldquo;I believe the wilderness will be
      new to all the party. The Miss Bertrams have never seen the wilderness
      yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No objection was made, but for some time there seemed no inclination to
      move in any plan, or to any distance. All were attracted at first by the
      plants or the pheasants, and all dispersed about in happy independence.
      Mr. Crawford was the first to move forward to examine the capabilities of
      that end of the house. The lawn, bounded on each side by a high wall,
      contained beyond the first planted area a bowling-green, and beyond the
      bowling-green a long terrace walk, backed by iron palisades, and
      commanding a view over them into the tops of the trees of the wilderness
      immediately adjoining. It was a good spot for fault-finding. Mr. Crawford
      was soon followed by Miss Bertram and Mr. Rushworth; and when, after a
      little time, the others began to form into parties, these three were found
      in busy consultation on the terrace by Edmund, Miss Crawford, and Fanny,
      who seemed as naturally to unite, and who, after a short participation of
      their regrets and difficulties, left them and walked on. The remaining
      three, Mrs. Rushworth, Mrs. Norris, and Julia, were still far behind; for
      Julia, whose happy star no longer prevailed, was obliged to keep by the
      side of Mrs. Rushworth, and restrain her impatient feet to that lady&rsquo;s
      slow pace, while her aunt, having fallen in with the housekeeper, who was
      come out to feed the pheasants, was lingering behind in gossip with her.
      Poor Julia, the only one out of the nine not tolerably satisfied with
      their lot, was now in a state of complete penance, and as different from
      the Julia of the barouche-box as could well be imagined. The politeness
      which she had been brought up to practise as a duty made it impossible for
      her to escape; while the want of that higher species of self-command, that
      just consideration of others, that knowledge of her own heart, that
      principle of right, which had not formed any essential part of her
      education, made her miserable under it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is insufferably hot,&rdquo; said Miss Crawford, when they had taken one
      turn on the terrace, and were drawing a second time to the door in the
      middle which opened to the wilderness. &ldquo;Shall any of us object to being
      comfortable? Here is a nice little wood, if one can but get into it. What
      happiness if the door should not be locked! but of course it is; for in
      these great places the gardeners are the only people who can go where they
      like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The door, however, proved not to be locked, and they were all agreed in
      turning joyfully through it, and leaving the unmitigated glare of day
      behind. A considerable flight of steps landed them in the wilderness,
      which was a planted wood of about two acres, and though chiefly of larch
      and laurel, and beech cut down, and though laid out with too much
      regularity, was darkness and shade, and natural beauty, compared with the
      bowling-green and the terrace. They all felt the refreshment of it, and
      for some time could only walk and admire. At length, after a short pause,
      Miss Crawford began with, &ldquo;So you are to be a clergyman, Mr. Bertram. This
      is rather a surprise to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should it surprise you? You must suppose me designed for some
      profession, and might perceive that I am neither a lawyer, nor a soldier,
      nor a sailor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very true; but, in short, it had not occurred to me. And you know there
      is generally an uncle or a grandfather to leave a fortune to the second
      son.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A very praiseworthy practice,&rdquo; said Edmund, &ldquo;but not quite universal. I
      am one of the exceptions, and <i>being</i> one, must do something for
      myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why are you to be a clergyman? I thought <i>that</i> was always the
      lot of the youngest, where there were many to chuse before him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think the church itself never chosen, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Never</i> is a black word. But yes, in the <i>never</i> of
      conversation, which means <i>not</i> <i>very</i> <i>often</i>, I do think
      it. For what is to be done in the church? Men love to distinguish
      themselves, and in either of the other lines distinction may be gained,
      but not in the church. A clergyman is nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The <i>nothing</i> of conversation has its gradations, I hope, as well as
      the <i>never</i>. A clergyman cannot be high in state or fashion. He must
      not head mobs, or set the ton in dress. But I cannot call that situation
      nothing which has the charge of all that is of the first importance to
      mankind, individually or collectively considered, temporally and
      eternally, which has the guardianship of religion and morals, and
      consequently of the manners which result from their influence. No one here
      can call the <i>office</i> nothing. If the man who holds it is so, it is
      by the neglect of his duty, by foregoing its just importance, and stepping
      out of his place to appear what he ought not to appear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>You</i> assign greater consequence to the clergyman than one has been
      used to hear given, or than I can quite comprehend. One does not see much
      of this influence and importance in society, and how can it be acquired
      where they are so seldom seen themselves? How can two sermons a week, even
      supposing them worth hearing, supposing the preacher to have the sense to
      prefer Blair&rsquo;s to his own, do all that you speak of? govern the conduct
      and fashion the manners of a large congregation for the rest of the week?
      One scarcely sees a clergyman out of his pulpit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>You</i> are speaking of London, <i>I</i> am speaking of the nation at
      large.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The metropolis, I imagine, is a pretty fair sample of the rest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not, I should hope, of the proportion of virtue to vice throughout the
      kingdom. We do not look in great cities for our best morality. It is not
      there that respectable people of any denomination can do most good; and it
      certainly is not there that the influence of the clergy can be most felt.
      A fine preacher is followed and admired; but it is not in fine preaching
      only that a good clergyman will be useful in his parish and his
      neighbourhood, where the parish and neighbourhood are of a size capable of
      knowing his private character, and observing his general conduct, which in
      London can rarely be the case. The clergy are lost there in the crowds of
      their parishioners. They are known to the largest part only as preachers.
      And with regard to their influencing public manners, Miss Crawford must
      not misunderstand me, or suppose I mean to call them the arbiters of
      good-breeding, the regulators of refinement and courtesy, the masters of
      the ceremonies of life. The <i>manners</i> I speak of might rather be
      called <i>conduct</i>, perhaps, the result of good principles; the effect,
      in short, of those doctrines which it is their duty to teach and
      recommend; and it will, I believe, be everywhere found, that as the clergy
      are, or are not what they ought to be, so are the rest of the nation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said Fanny, with gentle earnestness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There,&rdquo; cried Miss Crawford, &ldquo;you have quite convinced Miss Price
      already.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish I could convince Miss Crawford too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not think you ever will,&rdquo; said she, with an arch smile; &ldquo;I am just
      as much surprised now as I was at first that you should intend to take
      orders. You really are fit for something better. Come, do change your
      mind. It is not too late. Go into the law.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go into the law! With as much ease as I was told to go into this
      wilderness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now you are going to say something about law being the worst wilderness
      of the two, but I forestall you; remember, I have forestalled you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You need not hurry when the object is only to prevent my saying a <i>bon</i>
      <i>mot</i>, for there is not the least wit in my nature. I am a very
      matter-of-fact, plain-spoken being, and may blunder on the borders of a
      repartee for half an hour together without striking it out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A general silence succeeded. Each was thoughtful. Fanny made the first
      interruption by saying, &ldquo;I wonder that I should be tired with only walking
      in this sweet wood; but the next time we come to a seat, if it is not
      disagreeable to you, I should be glad to sit down for a little while.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Fanny,&rdquo; cried Edmund, immediately drawing her arm within his,
      &ldquo;how thoughtless I have been! I hope you are not very tired. Perhaps,&rdquo;
       turning to Miss Crawford, &ldquo;my other companion may do me the honour of
      taking an arm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, but I am not at all tired.&rdquo; She took it, however, as she
      spoke, and the gratification of having her do so, of feeling such a
      connexion for the first time, made him a little forgetful of Fanny. &ldquo;You
      scarcely touch me,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;You do not make me of any use. What a
      difference in the weight of a woman&rsquo;s arm from that of a man! At Oxford I
      have been a good deal used to have a man lean on me for the length of a
      street, and you are only a fly in the comparison.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am really not tired, which I almost wonder at; for we must have walked
      at least a mile in this wood. Do not you think we have?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not half a mile,&rdquo; was his sturdy answer; for he was not yet so much in
      love as to measure distance, or reckon time, with feminine lawlessness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! you do not consider how much we have wound about. We have taken such
      a very serpentine course, and the wood itself must be half a mile long in
      a straight line, for we have never seen the end of it yet since we left
      the first great path.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if you remember, before we left that first great path, we saw
      directly to the end of it. We looked down the whole vista, and saw it
      closed by iron gates, and it could not have been more than a furlong in
      length.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I know nothing of your furlongs, but I am sure it is a very long
      wood, and that we have been winding in and out ever since we came into it;
      and therefore, when I say that we have walked a mile in it, I must speak
      within compass.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have been exactly a quarter of an hour here,&rdquo; said Edmund, taking out
      his watch. &ldquo;Do you think we are walking four miles an hour?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! do not attack me with your watch. A watch is always too fast or too
      slow. I cannot be dictated to by a watch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A few steps farther brought them out at the bottom of the very walk they
      had been talking of; and standing back, well shaded and sheltered, and
      looking over a ha-ha into the park, was a comfortable-sized bench, on
      which they all sat down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid you are very tired, Fanny,&rdquo; said Edmund, observing her; &ldquo;why
      would not you speak sooner? This will be a bad day&rsquo;s amusement for you if
      you are to be knocked up. Every sort of exercise fatigues her so soon,
      Miss Crawford, except riding.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How abominable in you, then, to let me engross her horse as I did all
      last week! I am ashamed of you and of myself, but it shall never happen
      again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Your</i> attentiveness and consideration makes me more sensible of my
      own neglect. Fanny&rsquo;s interest seems in safer hands with you than with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That she should be tired now, however, gives me no surprise; for there is
      nothing in the course of one&rsquo;s duties so fatiguing as what we have been
      doing this morning: seeing a great house, dawdling from one room to
      another, straining one&rsquo;s eyes and one&rsquo;s attention, hearing what one does
      not understand, admiring what one does not care for. It is generally
      allowed to be the greatest bore in the world, and Miss Price has found it
      so, though she did not know it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall soon be rested,&rdquo; said Fanny; &ldquo;to sit in the shade on a fine day,
      and look upon verdure, is the most perfect refreshment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After sitting a little while Miss Crawford was up again. &ldquo;I must move,&rdquo;
       said she; &ldquo;resting fatigues me. I have looked across the ha-ha till I am
      weary. I must go and look through that iron gate at the same view, without
      being able to see it so well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Edmund left the seat likewise. &ldquo;Now, Miss Crawford, if you will look up
      the walk, you will convince yourself that it cannot be half a mile long,
      or half half a mile.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is an immense distance,&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;I see <i>that</i> with a glance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He still reasoned with her, but in vain. She would not calculate, she
      would not compare. She would only smile and assert. The greatest degree of
      rational consistency could not have been more engaging, and they talked
      with mutual satisfaction. At last it was agreed that they should endeavour
      to determine the dimensions of the wood by walking a little more about it.
      They would go to one end of it, in the line they were then in&mdash;for
      there was a straight green walk along the bottom by the side of the ha-ha&mdash;and
      perhaps turn a little way in some other direction, if it seemed likely to
      assist them, and be back in a few minutes. Fanny said she was rested, and
      would have moved too, but this was not suffered. Edmund urged her
      remaining where she was with an earnestness which she could not resist,
      and she was left on the bench to think with pleasure of her cousin&rsquo;s care,
      but with great regret that she was not stronger. She watched them till
      they had turned the corner, and listened till all sound of them had
      ceased.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER X
    </h2>
    <p>
      A quarter of an hour, twenty minutes, passed away, and Fanny was still
      thinking of Edmund, Miss Crawford, and herself, without interruption from
      any one. She began to be surprised at being left so long, and to listen
      with an anxious desire of hearing their steps and their voices again. She
      listened, and at length she heard; she heard voices and feet approaching;
      but she had just satisfied herself that it was not those she wanted, when
      Miss Bertram, Mr. Rushworth, and Mr. Crawford issued from the same path
      which she had trod herself, and were before her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Price all alone&rdquo; and &ldquo;My dear Fanny, how comes this?&rdquo; were the first
      salutations. She told her story. &ldquo;Poor dear Fanny,&rdquo; cried her cousin, &ldquo;how
      ill you have been used by them! You had better have staid with us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then seating herself with a gentleman on each side, she resumed the
      conversation which had engaged them before, and discussed the possibility
      of improvements with much animation. Nothing was fixed on; but Henry
      Crawford was full of ideas and projects, and, generally speaking, whatever
      he proposed was immediately approved, first by her, and then by Mr.
      Rushworth, whose principal business seemed to be to hear the others, and
      who scarcely risked an original thought of his own beyond a wish that they
      had seen his friend Smith&rsquo;s place.
    </p>
    <p>
      After some minutes spent in this way, Miss Bertram, observing the iron
      gate, expressed a wish of passing through it into the park, that their
      views and their plans might be more comprehensive. It was the very thing
      of all others to be wished, it was the best, it was the only way of
      proceeding with any advantage, in Henry Crawford&rsquo;s opinion; and he
      directly saw a knoll not half a mile off, which would give them exactly
      the requisite command of the house. Go therefore they must to that knoll,
      and through that gate; but the gate was locked. Mr. Rushworth wished he
      had brought the key; he had been very near thinking whether he should not
      bring the key; he was determined he would never come without the key
      again; but still this did not remove the present evil. They could not get
      through; and as Miss Bertram&rsquo;s inclination for so doing did by no means
      lessen, it ended in Mr. Rushworth&rsquo;s declaring outright that he would go
      and fetch the key. He set off accordingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is undoubtedly the best thing we can do now, as we are so far from the
      house already,&rdquo; said Mr. Crawford, when he was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, there is nothing else to be done. But now, sincerely, do not you
      find the place altogether worse than you expected?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, indeed, far otherwise. I find it better, grander, more complete in
      its style, though that style may not be the best. And to tell you the
      truth,&rdquo; speaking rather lower, &ldquo;I do not think that <i>I</i> shall ever
      see Sotherton again with so much pleasure as I do now. Another summer will
      hardly improve it to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After a moment&rsquo;s embarrassment the lady replied, &ldquo;You are too much a man
      of the world not to see with the eyes of the world. If other people think
      Sotherton improved, I have no doubt that you will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid I am not quite so much the man of the world as might be good
      for me in some points. My feelings are not quite so evanescent, nor my
      memory of the past under such easy dominion as one finds to be the case
      with men of the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was followed by a short silence. Miss Bertram began again. &ldquo;You
      seemed to enjoy your drive here very much this morning. I was glad to see
      you so well entertained. You and Julia were laughing the whole way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were we? Yes, I believe we were; but I have not the least recollection at
      what. Oh! I believe I was relating to her some ridiculous stories of an
      old Irish groom of my uncle&rsquo;s. Your sister loves to laugh.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think her more light-hearted than I am?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;More easily amused,&rdquo; he replied; &ldquo;consequently, you know,&rdquo; smiling,
      &ldquo;better company. I could not have hoped to entertain you with Irish
      anecdotes during a ten miles&rsquo; drive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Naturally, I believe, I am as lively as Julia, but I have more to think
      of now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have, undoubtedly; and there are situations in which very high
      spirits would denote insensibility. Your prospects, however, are too fair
      to justify want of spirits. You have a very smiling scene before you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean literally or figuratively? Literally, I conclude. Yes,
      certainly, the sun shines, and the park looks very cheerful. But unluckily
      that iron gate, that ha-ha, give me a feeling of restraint and hardship.
      &lsquo;I cannot get out,&rsquo; as the starling said.&rdquo; As she spoke, and it was with
      expression, she walked to the gate: he followed her. &ldquo;Mr. Rushworth is so
      long fetching this key!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And for the world you would not get out without the key and without Mr.
      Rushworth&rsquo;s authority and protection, or I think you might with little
      difficulty pass round the edge of the gate, here, with my assistance; I
      think it might be done, if you really wished to be more at large, and
      could allow yourself to think it not prohibited.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Prohibited! nonsense! I certainly can get out that way, and I will. Mr.
      Rushworth will be here in a moment, you know; we shall not be out of
      sight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or if we are, Miss Price will be so good as to tell him that he will find
      us near that knoll: the grove of oak on the knoll.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fanny, feeling all this to be wrong, could not help making an effort to
      prevent it. &ldquo;You will hurt yourself, Miss Bertram,&rdquo; she cried; &ldquo;you will
      certainly hurt yourself against those spikes; you will tear your gown; you
      will be in danger of slipping into the ha-ha. You had better not go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her cousin was safe on the other side while these words were spoken, and,
      smiling with all the good-humour of success, she said, &ldquo;Thank you, my dear
      Fanny, but I and my gown are alive and well, and so good-bye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fanny was again left to her solitude, and with no increase of pleasant
      feelings, for she was sorry for almost all that she had seen and heard,
      astonished at Miss Bertram, and angry with Mr. Crawford. By taking a
      circuitous route, and, as it appeared to her, very unreasonable direction
      to the knoll, they were soon beyond her eye; and for some minutes longer
      she remained without sight or sound of any companion. She seemed to have
      the little wood all to herself. She could almost have thought that Edmund
      and Miss Crawford had left it, but that it was impossible for Edmund to
      forget her so entirely.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was again roused from disagreeable musings by sudden footsteps:
      somebody was coming at a quick pace down the principal walk. She expected
      Mr. Rushworth, but it was Julia, who, hot and out of breath, and with a
      look of disappointment, cried out on seeing her, &ldquo;Heyday! Where are the
      others? I thought Maria and Mr. Crawford were with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fanny explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A pretty trick, upon my word! I cannot see them anywhere,&rdquo; looking
      eagerly into the park. &ldquo;But they cannot be very far off, and I think I am
      equal to as much as Maria, even without help.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Julia, Mr. Rushworth will be here in a moment with the key. Do wait
      for Mr. Rushworth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not I, indeed. I have had enough of the family for one morning. Why,
      child, I have but this moment escaped from his horrible mother. Such a
      penance as I have been enduring, while you were sitting here so composed
      and so happy! It might have been as well, perhaps, if you had been in my
      place, but you always contrive to keep out of these scrapes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was a most unjust reflection, but Fanny could allow for it, and let
      it pass: Julia was vexed, and her temper was hasty; but she felt that it
      would not last, and therefore, taking no notice, only asked her if she had
      not seen Mr. Rushworth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, we saw him. He was posting away as if upon life and death, and
      could but just spare time to tell us his errand, and where you all were.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a pity he should have so much trouble for nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>That</i> is Miss Maria&rsquo;s concern. I am not obliged to punish myself
      for <i>her</i> sins. The mother I could not avoid, as long as my tiresome
      aunt was dancing about with the housekeeper, but the son I <i>can</i> get
      away from.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And she immediately scrambled across the fence, and walked away, not
      attending to Fanny&rsquo;s last question of whether she had seen anything of
      Miss Crawford and Edmund. The sort of dread in which Fanny now sat of
      seeing Mr. Rushworth prevented her thinking so much of their continued
      absence, however, as she might have done. She felt that he had been very
      ill-used, and was quite unhappy in having to communicate what had passed.
      He joined her within five minutes after Julia&rsquo;s exit; and though she made
      the best of the story, he was evidently mortified and displeased in no
      common degree. At first he scarcely said anything; his looks only
      expressed his extreme surprise and vexation, and he walked to the gate and
      stood there, without seeming to know what to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They desired me to stay&mdash;my cousin Maria charged me to say that you
      would find them at that knoll, or thereabouts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not believe I shall go any farther,&rdquo; said he sullenly; &ldquo;I see
      nothing of them. By the time I get to the knoll they may be gone somewhere
      else. I have had walking enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he sat down with a most gloomy countenance by Fanny.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very sorry,&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;it is very unlucky.&rdquo; And she longed to be
      able to say something more to the purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      After an interval of silence, &ldquo;I think they might as well have staid for
      me,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Bertram thought you would follow her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should not have had to follow her if she had staid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This could not be denied, and Fanny was silenced. After another pause, he
      went on&mdash;&ldquo;Pray, Miss Price, are you such a great admirer of this Mr.
      Crawford as some people are? For my part, I can see nothing in him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not think him at all handsome.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Handsome! Nobody can call such an undersized man handsome. He is not five
      foot nine. I should not wonder if he is not more than five foot eight. I
      think he is an ill-looking fellow. In my opinion, these Crawfords are no
      addition at all. We did very well without them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A small sigh escaped Fanny here, and she did not know how to contradict
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I had made any difficulty about fetching the key, there might have
      been some excuse, but I went the very moment she said she wanted it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing could be more obliging than your manner, I am sure, and I dare
      say you walked as fast as you could; but still it is some distance, you
      know, from this spot to the house, quite into the house; and when people
      are waiting, they are bad judges of time, and every half minute seems like
      five.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He got up and walked to the gate again, and &ldquo;wished he had had the key
      about him at the time.&rdquo; Fanny thought she discerned in his standing there
      an indication of relenting, which encouraged her to another attempt, and
      she said, therefore, &ldquo;It is a pity you should not join them. They expected
      to have a better view of the house from that part of the park, and will be
      thinking how it may be improved; and nothing of that sort, you know, can
      be settled without you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She found herself more successful in sending away than in retaining a
      companion. Mr. Rushworth was worked on. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;if you really
      think I had better go: it would be foolish to bring the key for nothing.&rdquo;
       And letting himself out, he walked off without farther ceremony.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fanny&rsquo;s thoughts were now all engrossed by the two who had left her so
      long ago, and getting quite impatient, she resolved to go in search of
      them. She followed their steps along the bottom walk, and had just turned
      up into another, when the voice and the laugh of Miss Crawford once more
      caught her ear; the sound approached, and a few more windings brought them
      before her. They were just returned into the wilderness from the park, to
      which a sidegate, not fastened, had tempted them very soon after their
      leaving her, and they had been across a portion of the park into the very
      avenue which Fanny had been hoping the whole morning to reach at last, and
      had been sitting down under one of the trees. This was their history. It
      was evident that they had been spending their time pleasantly, and were
      not aware of the length of their absence. Fanny&rsquo;s best consolation was in
      being assured that Edmund had wished for her very much, and that he should
      certainly have come back for her, had she not been tired already; but this
      was not quite sufficient to do away with the pain of having been left a
      whole hour, when he had talked of only a few minutes, nor to banish the
      sort of curiosity she felt to know what they had been conversing about all
      that time; and the result of the whole was to her disappointment and
      depression, as they prepared by general agreement to return to the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      On reaching the bottom of the steps to the terrace, Mrs. Rushworth and
      Mrs. Norris presented themselves at the top, just ready for the
      wilderness, at the end of an hour and a half from their leaving the house.
      Mrs. Norris had been too well employed to move faster. Whatever
      cross-accidents had occurred to intercept the pleasures of her nieces, she
      had found a morning of complete enjoyment; for the housekeeper, after a
      great many courtesies on the subject of pheasants, had taken her to the
      dairy, told her all about their cows, and given her the receipt for a
      famous cream cheese; and since Julia&rsquo;s leaving them they had been met by
      the gardener, with whom she had made a most satisfactory acquaintance, for
      she had set him right as to his grandson&rsquo;s illness, convinced him that it
      was an ague, and promised him a charm for it; and he, in return, had shewn
      her all his choicest nursery of plants, and actually presented her with a
      very curious specimen of heath.
    </p>
    <p>
      On this <i>rencontre</i> they all returned to the house together, there to
      lounge away the time as they could with sofas, and chit-chat, and
      Quarterly Reviews, till the return of the others, and the arrival of
      dinner. It was late before the Miss Bertrams and the two gentlemen came
      in, and their ramble did not appear to have been more than partially
      agreeable, or at all productive of anything useful with regard to the
      object of the day. By their own accounts they had been all walking after
      each other, and the junction which had taken place at last seemed, to
      Fanny&rsquo;s observation, to have been as much too late for re-establishing
      harmony, as it confessedly had been for determining on any alteration. She
      felt, as she looked at Julia and Mr. Rushworth, that hers was not the only
      dissatisfied bosom amongst them: there was gloom on the face of each. Mr.
      Crawford and Miss Bertram were much more gay, and she thought that he was
      taking particular pains, during dinner, to do away any little resentment
      of the other two, and restore general good-humour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dinner was soon followed by tea and coffee, a ten miles&rsquo; drive home
      allowed no waste of hours; and from the time of their sitting down to
      table, it was a quick succession of busy nothings till the carriage came
      to the door, and Mrs. Norris, having fidgeted about, and obtained a few
      pheasants&rsquo; eggs and a cream cheese from the housekeeper, and made
      abundance of civil speeches to Mrs. Rushworth, was ready to lead the way.
      At the same moment Mr. Crawford, approaching Julia, said, &ldquo;I hope I am not
      to lose my companion, unless she is afraid of the evening air in so
      exposed a seat.&rdquo; The request had not been foreseen, but was very
      graciously received, and Julia&rsquo;s day was likely to end almost as well as
      it began. Miss Bertram had made up her mind to something different, and
      was a little disappointed; but her conviction of being really the one
      preferred comforted her under it, and enabled her to receive Mr.
      Rushworth&rsquo;s parting attentions as she ought. He was certainly better
      pleased to hand her into the barouche than to assist her in ascending the
      box, and his complacency seemed confirmed by the arrangement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Fanny, this has been a fine day for you, upon my word,&rdquo; said Mrs.
      Norris, as they drove through the park. &ldquo;Nothing but pleasure from
      beginning to end! I am sure you ought to be very much obliged to your aunt
      Bertram and me for contriving to let you go. A pretty good day&rsquo;s amusement
      you have had!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Maria was just discontented enough to say directly, &ldquo;I think <i>you</i>
      have done pretty well yourself, ma&rsquo;am. Your lap seems full of good things,
      and here is a basket of something between us which has been knocking my
      elbow unmercifully.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear, it is only a beautiful little heath, which that nice old
      gardener would make me take; but if it is in your way, I will have it in
      my lap directly. There, Fanny, you shall carry that parcel for me; take
      great care of it: do not let it fall; it is a cream cheese, just like the
      excellent one we had at dinner. Nothing would satisfy that good old Mrs.
      Whitaker, but my taking one of the cheeses. I stood out as long as I
      could, till the tears almost came into her eyes, and I knew it was just
      the sort that my sister would be delighted with. That Mrs. Whitaker is a
      treasure! She was quite shocked when I asked her whether wine was allowed
      at the second table, and she has turned away two housemaids for wearing
      white gowns. Take care of the cheese, Fanny. Now I can manage the other
      parcel and the basket very well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What else have you been spunging?&rdquo; said Maria, half-pleased that
      Sotherton should be so complimented.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Spunging, my dear! It is nothing but four of those beautiful pheasants&rsquo; 
      eggs, which Mrs. Whitaker would quite force upon me: she would not take a
      denial. She said it must be such an amusement to me, as she understood I
      lived quite alone, to have a few living creatures of that sort; and so to
      be sure it will. I shall get the dairymaid to set them under the first
      spare hen, and if they come to good I can have them moved to my own house
      and borrow a coop; and it will be a great delight to me in my lonely hours
      to attend to them. And if I have good luck, your mother shall have some.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was a beautiful evening, mild and still, and the drive was as pleasant
      as the serenity of Nature could make it; but when Mrs. Norris ceased
      speaking, it was altogether a silent drive to those within. Their spirits
      were in general exhausted; and to determine whether the day had afforded
      most pleasure or pain, might occupy the meditations of almost all.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XI
    </h2>
    <p>
      The day at Sotherton, with all its imperfections, afforded the Miss
      Bertrams much more agreeable feelings than were derived from the letters
      from Antigua, which soon afterwards reached Mansfield. It was much
      pleasanter to think of Henry Crawford than of their father; and to think
      of their father in England again within a certain period, which these
      letters obliged them to do, was a most unwelcome exercise.
    </p>
    <p>
      November was the black month fixed for his return. Sir Thomas wrote of it
      with as much decision as experience and anxiety could authorise. His
      business was so nearly concluded as to justify him in proposing to take
      his passage in the September packet, and he consequently looked forward
      with the hope of being with his beloved family again early in November.
    </p>
    <p>
      Maria was more to be pitied than Julia; for to her the father brought a
      husband, and the return of the friend most solicitous for her happiness
      would unite her to the lover, on whom she had chosen that happiness should
      depend. It was a gloomy prospect, and all she could do was to throw a mist
      over it, and hope when the mist cleared away she should see something
      else. It would hardly be <i>early</i> in November, there were generally
      delays, a bad passage or <i>something</i>; that favouring <i>something</i>
      which everybody who shuts their eyes while they look, or their
      understandings while they reason, feels the comfort of. It would probably
      be the middle of November at least; the middle of November was three
      months off. Three months comprised thirteen weeks. Much might happen in
      thirteen weeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Thomas would have been deeply mortified by a suspicion of half that
      his daughters felt on the subject of his return, and would hardly have
      found consolation in a knowledge of the interest it excited in the breast
      of another young lady. Miss Crawford, on walking up with her brother to
      spend the evening at Mansfield Park, heard the good news; and though
      seeming to have no concern in the affair beyond politeness, and to have
      vented all her feelings in a quiet congratulation, heard it with an
      attention not so easily satisfied. Mrs. Norris gave the particulars of the
      letters, and the subject was dropt; but after tea, as Miss Crawford was
      standing at an open window with Edmund and Fanny looking out on a twilight
      scene, while the Miss Bertrams, Mr. Rushworth, and Henry Crawford were all
      busy with candles at the pianoforte, she suddenly revived it by turning
      round towards the group, and saying, &ldquo;How happy Mr. Rushworth looks! He is
      thinking of November.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Edmund looked round at Mr. Rushworth too, but had nothing to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your father&rsquo;s return will be a very interesting event.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will, indeed, after such an absence; an absence not only long, but
      including so many dangers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will be the forerunner also of other interesting events: your sister&rsquo;s
      marriage, and your taking orders.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be affronted,&rdquo; said she, laughing, &ldquo;but it does put me in mind of
      some of the old heathen heroes, who, after performing great exploits in a
      foreign land, offered sacrifices to the gods on their safe return.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no sacrifice in the case,&rdquo; replied Edmund, with a serious smile,
      and glancing at the pianoforte again; &ldquo;it is entirely her own doing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes I know it is. I was merely joking. She has done no more than what
      every young woman would do; and I have no doubt of her being extremely
      happy. My other sacrifice, of course, you do not understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My taking orders, I assure you, is quite as voluntary as Maria&rsquo;s
      marrying.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is fortunate that your inclination and your father&rsquo;s convenience
      should accord so well. There is a very good living kept for you, I
      understand, hereabouts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which you suppose has biassed me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But <i>that</i> I am sure it has not,&rdquo; cried Fanny.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you for your good word, Fanny, but it is more than I would affirm
      myself. On the contrary, the knowing that there was such a provision for
      me probably did bias me. Nor can I think it wrong that it should. There
      was no natural disinclination to be overcome, and I see no reason why a
      man should make a worse clergyman for knowing that he will have a
      competence early in life. I was in safe hands. I hope I should not have
      been influenced myself in a wrong way, and I am sure my father was too
      conscientious to have allowed it. I have no doubt that I was biased, but I
      think it was blamelessly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the same sort of thing,&rdquo; said Fanny, after a short pause, &ldquo;as for
      the son of an admiral to go into the navy, or the son of a general to be
      in the army, and nobody sees anything wrong in that. Nobody wonders that
      they should prefer the line where their friends can serve them best, or
      suspects them to be less in earnest in it than they appear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, my dear Miss Price, and for reasons good. The profession, either navy
      or army, is its own justification. It has everything in its favour:
      heroism, danger, bustle, fashion. Soldiers and sailors are always
      acceptable in society. Nobody can wonder that men are soldiers and
      sailors.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the motives of a man who takes orders with the certainty of
      preferment may be fairly suspected, you think?&rdquo; said Edmund. &ldquo;To be
      justified in your eyes, he must do it in the most complete uncertainty of
      any provision.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! take orders without a living! No; that is madness indeed; absolute
      madness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I ask you how the church is to be filled, if a man is neither to
      take orders with a living nor without? No; for you certainly would not
      know what to say. But I must beg some advantage to the clergyman from your
      own argument. As he cannot be influenced by those feelings which you rank
      highly as temptation and reward to the soldier and sailor in their choice
      of a profession, as heroism, and noise, and fashion, are all against him,
      he ought to be less liable to the suspicion of wanting sincerity or good
      intentions in the choice of his.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! no doubt he is very sincere in preferring an income ready made, to
      the trouble of working for one; and has the best intentions of doing
      nothing all the rest of his days but eat, drink, and grow fat. It is
      indolence, Mr. Bertram, indeed. Indolence and love of ease; a want of all
      laudable ambition, of taste for good company, or of inclination to take
      the trouble of being agreeable, which make men clergymen. A clergyman has
      nothing to do but be slovenly and selfish&mdash;read the newspaper, watch
      the weather, and quarrel with his wife. His curate does all the work, and
      the business of his own life is to dine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are such clergymen, no doubt, but I think they are not so common as
      to justify Miss Crawford in esteeming it their general character. I
      suspect that in this comprehensive and (may I say) commonplace censure,
      you are not judging from yourself, but from prejudiced persons, whose
      opinions you have been in the habit of hearing. It is impossible that your
      own observation can have given you much knowledge of the clergy. You can
      have been personally acquainted with very few of a set of men you condemn
      so conclusively. You are speaking what you have been told at your uncle&rsquo;s
      table.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I speak what appears to me the general opinion; and where an opinion is
      general, it is usually correct. Though <i>I</i> have not seen much of the
      domestic lives of clergymen, it is seen by too many to leave any
      deficiency of information.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where any one body of educated men, of whatever denomination, are
      condemned indiscriminately, there must be a deficiency of information, or
      (smiling) of something else. Your uncle, and his brother admirals, perhaps
      knew little of clergymen beyond the chaplains whom, good or bad, they were
      always wishing away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor William! He has met with great kindness from the chaplain of the
      Antwerp,&rdquo; was a tender apostrophe of Fanny&rsquo;s, very much to the purpose of
      her own feelings if not of the conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been so little addicted to take my opinions from my uncle,&rdquo; said
      Miss Crawford, &ldquo;that I can hardly suppose&mdash;and since you push me so
      hard, I must observe, that I am not entirely without the means of seeing
      what clergymen are, being at this present time the guest of my own
      brother, Dr. Grant. And though Dr. Grant is most kind and obliging to me,
      and though he is really a gentleman, and, I dare say, a good scholar and
      clever, and often preaches good sermons, and is very respectable, <i>I</i>
      see him to be an indolent, selfish <i>bon</i> <i>vivant</i>, who must have
      his palate consulted in everything; who will not stir a finger for the
      convenience of any one; and who, moreover, if the cook makes a blunder, is
      out of humour with his excellent wife. To own the truth, Henry and I were
      partly driven out this very evening by a disappointment about a green
      goose, which he could not get the better of. My poor sister was forced to
      stay and bear it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not wonder at your disapprobation, upon my word. It is a great
      defect of temper, made worse by a very faulty habit of self-indulgence;
      and to see your sister suffering from it must be exceedingly painful to
      such feelings as yours. Fanny, it goes against us. We cannot attempt to
      defend Dr. Grant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Fanny, &ldquo;but we need not give up his profession for all that;
      because, whatever profession Dr. Grant had chosen, he would have taken a&mdash;not
      a good temper into it; and as he must, either in the navy or army, have
      had a great many more people under his command than he has now, I think
      more would have been made unhappy by him as a sailor or soldier than as a
      clergyman. Besides, I cannot but suppose that whatever there may be to
      wish otherwise in Dr. Grant would have been in a greater danger of
      becoming worse in a more active and worldly profession, where he would
      have had less time and obligation&mdash;where he might have escaped that
      knowledge of himself, the <i>frequency</i>, at least, of that knowledge
      which it is impossible he should escape as he is now. A man&mdash;a
      sensible man like Dr. Grant, cannot be in the habit of teaching others
      their duty every week, cannot go to church twice every Sunday, and preach
      such very good sermons in so good a manner as he does, without being the
      better for it himself. It must make him think; and I have no doubt that he
      oftener endeavours to restrain himself than he would if he had been
      anything but a clergyman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We cannot prove to the contrary, to be sure; but I wish you a better
      fate, Miss Price, than to be the wife of a man whose amiableness depends
      upon his own sermons; for though he may preach himself into a good-humour
      every Sunday, it will be bad enough to have him quarrelling about green
      geese from Monday morning till Saturday night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think the man who could often quarrel with Fanny,&rdquo; said Edmund
      affectionately, &ldquo;must be beyond the reach of any sermons.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fanny turned farther into the window; and Miss Crawford had only time to
      say, in a pleasant manner, &ldquo;I fancy Miss Price has been more used to
      deserve praise than to hear it&rdquo;; when, being earnestly invited by the Miss
      Bertrams to join in a glee, she tripped off to the instrument, leaving
      Edmund looking after her in an ecstasy of admiration of all her many
      virtues, from her obliging manners down to her light and graceful tread.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There goes good-humour, I am sure,&rdquo; said he presently. &ldquo;There goes a
      temper which would never give pain! How well she walks! and how readily
      she falls in with the inclination of others! joining them the moment she
      is asked. What a pity,&rdquo; he added, after an instant&rsquo;s reflection, &ldquo;that she
      should have been in such hands!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fanny agreed to it, and had the pleasure of seeing him continue at the
      window with her, in spite of the expected glee; and of having his eyes
      soon turned, like hers, towards the scene without, where all that was
      solemn, and soothing, and lovely, appeared in the brilliancy of an
      unclouded night, and the contrast of the deep shade of the woods. Fanny
      spoke her feelings. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s harmony!&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;here&rsquo;s repose! Here&rsquo;s
      what may leave all painting and all music behind, and what poetry only can
      attempt to describe! Here&rsquo;s what may tranquillise every care, and lift the
      heart to rapture! When I look out on such a night as this, I feel as if
      there could be neither wickedness nor sorrow in the world; and there
      certainly would be less of both if the sublimity of Nature were more
      attended to, and people were carried more out of themselves by
      contemplating such a scene.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I like to hear your enthusiasm, Fanny. It is a lovely night, and they are
      much to be pitied who have not been taught to feel, in some degree, as you
      do; who have not, at least, been given a taste for Nature in early life.
      They lose a great deal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>You</i> taught me to think and feel on the subject, cousin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had a very apt scholar. There&rsquo;s Arcturus looking very bright.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and the Bear. I wish I could see Cassiopeia.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must go out on the lawn for that. Should you be afraid?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not in the least. It is a great while since we have had any star-gazing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I do not know how it has happened.&rdquo; The glee began. &ldquo;We will stay
      till this is finished, Fanny,&rdquo; said he, turning his back on the window;
      and as it advanced, she had the mortification of seeing him advance too,
      moving forward by gentle degrees towards the instrument, and when it
      ceased, he was close by the singers, among the most urgent in requesting
      to hear the glee again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fanny sighed alone at the window till scolded away by Mrs. Norris&rsquo;s
      threats of catching cold.

      CHAPTER XII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Sir Thomas was to return in November, and his eldest son had duties to
      call him earlier home. The approach of September brought tidings of Mr.
      Bertram, first in a letter to the gamekeeper and then in a letter to
      Edmund; and by the end of August he arrived himself, to be gay, agreeable,
      and gallant again as occasion served, or Miss Crawford demanded; to tell
      of races and Weymouth, and parties and friends, to which she might have
      listened six weeks before with some interest, and altogether to give her
      the fullest conviction, by the power of actual comparison, of her
      preferring his younger brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was very vexatious, and she was heartily sorry for it; but so it was;
      and so far from now meaning to marry the elder, she did not even want to
      attract him beyond what the simplest claims of conscious beauty required:
      his lengthened absence from Mansfield, without anything but pleasure in
      view, and his own will to consult, made it perfectly clear that he did not
      care about her; and his indifference was so much more than equalled by her
      own, that were he now to step forth the owner of Mansfield Park, the Sir
      Thomas complete, which he was to be in time, she did not believe she could
      accept him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The season and duties which brought Mr. Bertram back to Mansfield took Mr.
      Crawford into Norfolk. Everingham could not do without him in the
      beginning of September. He went for a fortnight&mdash;a fortnight of such
      dullness to the Miss Bertrams as ought to have put them both on their
      guard, and made even Julia admit, in her jealousy of her sister, the
      absolute necessity of distrusting his attentions, and wishing him not to
      return; and a fortnight of sufficient leisure, in the intervals of
      shooting and sleeping, to have convinced the gentleman that he ought to
      keep longer away, had he been more in the habit of examining his own
      motives, and of reflecting to what the indulgence of his idle vanity was
      tending; but, thoughtless and selfish from prosperity and bad example, he
      would not look beyond the present moment. The sisters, handsome, clever,
      and encouraging, were an amusement to his sated mind; and finding nothing
      in Norfolk to equal the social pleasures of Mansfield, he gladly returned
      to it at the time appointed, and was welcomed thither quite as gladly by
      those whom he came to trifle with further.
    </p>
    <p>
      Maria, with only Mr. Rushworth to attend to her, and doomed to the
      repeated details of his day&rsquo;s sport, good or bad, his boast of his dogs,
      his jealousy of his neighbours, his doubts of their qualifications, and
      his zeal after poachers, subjects which will not find their way to female
      feelings without some talent on one side or some attachment on the other,
      had missed Mr. Crawford grievously; and Julia, unengaged and unemployed,
      felt all the right of missing him much more. Each sister believed herself
      the favourite. Julia might be justified in so doing by the hints of Mrs.
      Grant, inclined to credit what she wished, and Maria by the hints of Mr.
      Crawford himself. Everything returned into the same channel as before his
      absence; his manners being to each so animated and agreeable as to lose no
      ground with either, and just stopping short of the consistence, the
      steadiness, the solicitude, and the warmth which might excite general
      notice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fanny was the only one of the party who found anything to dislike; but
      since the day at Sotherton, she could never see Mr. Crawford with either
      sister without observation, and seldom without wonder or censure; and had
      her confidence in her own judgment been equal to her exercise of it in
      every other respect, had she been sure that she was seeing clearly, and
      judging candidly, she would probably have made some important
      communications to her usual confidant. As it was, however, she only
      hazarded a hint, and the hint was lost. &ldquo;I am rather surprised,&rdquo; said she,
      &ldquo;that Mr. Crawford should come back again so soon, after being here so
      long before, full seven weeks; for I had understood he was so very fond of
      change and moving about, that I thought something would certainly occur,
      when he was once gone, to take him elsewhere. He is used to much gayer
      places than Mansfield.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is to his credit,&rdquo; was Edmund&rsquo;s answer; &ldquo;and I dare say it gives his
      sister pleasure. She does not like his unsettled habits.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a favourite he is with my cousins!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, his manners to women are such as must please. Mrs. Grant, I believe,
      suspects him of a preference for Julia; I have never seen much symptom of
      it, but I wish it may be so. He has no faults but what a serious
      attachment would remove.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If Miss Bertram were not engaged,&rdquo; said Fanny cautiously, &ldquo;I could
      sometimes almost think that he admired her more than Julia.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which is, perhaps, more in favour of his liking Julia best, than you,
      Fanny, may be aware; for I believe it often happens that a man, before he
      has quite made up his own mind, will distinguish the sister or intimate
      friend of the woman he is really thinking of more than the woman herself.
      Crawford has too much sense to stay here if he found himself in any danger
      from Maria; and I am not at all afraid for her, after such a proof as she
      has given that her feelings are not strong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fanny supposed she must have been mistaken, and meant to think differently
      in future; but with all that submission to Edmund could do, and all the
      help of the coinciding looks and hints which she occasionally noticed in
      some of the others, and which seemed to say that Julia was Mr. Crawford&rsquo;s
      choice, she knew not always what to think. She was privy, one evening, to
      the hopes of her aunt Norris on the subject, as well as to her feelings,
      and the feelings of Mrs. Rushworth, on a point of some similarity, and
      could not help wondering as she listened; and glad would she have been not
      to be obliged to listen, for it was while all the other young people were
      dancing, and she sitting, most unwillingly, among the chaperons at the
      fire, longing for the re-entrance of her elder cousin, on whom all her own
      hopes of a partner then depended. It was Fanny&rsquo;s first ball, though
      without the preparation or splendour of many a young lady&rsquo;s first ball,
      being the thought only of the afternoon, built on the late acquisition of
      a violin player in the servants&rsquo; hall, and the possibility of raising five
      couple with the help of Mrs. Grant and a new intimate friend of Mr.
      Bertram&rsquo;s just arrived on a visit. It had, however, been a very happy one
      to Fanny through four dances, and she was quite grieved to be losing even
      a quarter of an hour. While waiting and wishing, looking now at the
      dancers and now at the door, this dialogue between the two above-mentioned
      ladies was forced on her&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said Mrs. Norris, her eyes directed towards Mr.
      Rushworth and Maria, who were partners for the second time, &ldquo;we shall see
      some happy faces again now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, ma&rsquo;am, indeed,&rdquo; replied the other, with a stately simper, &ldquo;there
      will be some satisfaction in looking on <i>now</i>, and I think it was
      rather a pity they should have been obliged to part. Young folks in their
      situation should be excused complying with the common forms. I wonder my
      son did not propose it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare say he did, ma&rsquo;am. Mr. Rushworth is never remiss. But dear Maria
      has such a strict sense of propriety, so much of that true delicacy which
      one seldom meets with nowadays, Mrs. Rushworth&mdash;that wish of avoiding
      particularity! Dear ma&rsquo;am, only look at her face at this moment; how
      different from what it was the two last dances!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Bertram did indeed look happy, her eyes were sparkling with pleasure,
      and she was speaking with great animation, for Julia and her partner, Mr.
      Crawford, were close to her; they were all in a cluster together. How she
      had looked before, Fanny could not recollect, for she had been dancing
      with Edmund herself, and had not thought about her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Norris continued, &ldquo;It is quite delightful, ma&rsquo;am, to see young people
      so properly happy, so well suited, and so much the thing! I cannot but
      think of dear Sir Thomas&rsquo;s delight. And what do you say, ma&rsquo;am, to the
      chance of another match? Mr. Rushworth has set a good example, and such
      things are very catching.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Rushworth, who saw nothing but her son, was quite at a loss.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The couple above, ma&rsquo;am. Do you see no symptoms there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh dear! Miss Julia and Mr. Crawford. Yes, indeed, a very pretty match.
      What is his property?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Four thousand a year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well. Those who have not more must be satisfied with what they have.
      Four thousand a year is a pretty estate, and he seems a very genteel,
      steady young man, so I hope Miss Julia will be very happy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not a settled thing, ma&rsquo;am, yet. We only speak of it among friends.
      But I have very little doubt it <i>will</i> be. He is growing extremely
      particular in his attentions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fanny could listen no farther. Listening and wondering were all suspended
      for a time, for Mr. Bertram was in the room again; and though feeling it
      would be a great honour to be asked by him, she thought it must happen. He
      came towards their little circle; but instead of asking her to dance, drew
      a chair near her, and gave her an account of the present state of a sick
      horse, and the opinion of the groom, from whom he had just parted. Fanny
      found that it was not to be, and in the modesty of her nature immediately
      felt that she had been unreasonable in expecting it. When he had told of
      his horse, he took a newspaper from the table, and looking over it, said
      in a languid way, &ldquo;If you want to dance, Fanny, I will stand up with you.&rdquo;
       With more than equal civility the offer was declined; she did not wish to
      dance. &ldquo;I am glad of it,&rdquo; said he, in a much brisker tone, and throwing
      down the newspaper again, &ldquo;for I am tired to death. I only wonder how the
      good people can keep it up so long. They had need be <i>all</i> in love,
      to find any amusement in such folly; and so they are, I fancy. If you look
      at them you may see they are so many couple of lovers&mdash;all but Yates
      and Mrs. Grant&mdash;and, between ourselves, she, poor woman, must want a
      lover as much as any one of them. A desperate dull life hers must be with
      the doctor,&rdquo; making a sly face as he spoke towards the chair of the
      latter, who proving, however, to be close at his elbow, made so
      instantaneous a change of expression and subject necessary, as Fanny, in
      spite of everything, could hardly help laughing at. &ldquo;A strange business
      this in America, Dr. Grant! What is your opinion? I always come to you to
      know what I am to think of public matters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Tom,&rdquo; cried his aunt soon afterwards, &ldquo;as you are not dancing, I
      dare say you will have no objection to join us in a rubber; shall you?&rdquo;
       Then leaving her seat, and coming to him to enforce the proposal, added in
      a whisper, &ldquo;We want to make a table for Mrs. Rushworth, you know. Your
      mother is quite anxious about it, but cannot very well spare time to sit
      down herself, because of her fringe. Now, you and I and Dr. Grant will
      just do; and though <i>we</i> play but half-crowns, you know, you may bet
      half-guineas with <i>him</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should be most happy,&rdquo; replied he aloud, and jumping up with alacrity,
      &ldquo;it would give me the greatest pleasure; but that I am this moment going
      to dance.&rdquo; Come, Fanny, taking her hand, &ldquo;do not be dawdling any longer,
      or the dance will be over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fanny was led off very willingly, though it was impossible for her to feel
      much gratitude towards her cousin, or distinguish, as he certainly did,
      between the selfishness of another person and his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A pretty modest request upon my word,&rdquo; he indignantly exclaimed as they
      walked away. &ldquo;To want to nail me to a card-table for the next two hours
      with herself and Dr. Grant, who are always quarrelling, and that poking
      old woman, who knows no more of whist than of algebra. I wish my good aunt
      would be a little less busy! And to ask me in such a way too! without
      ceremony, before them all, so as to leave me no possibility of refusing.
      <i>That</i> is what I dislike most particularly. It raises my spleen more
      than anything, to have the pretence of being asked, of being given a
      choice, and at the same time addressed in such a way as to oblige one to
      do the very thing, whatever it be! If I had not luckily thought of
      standing up with you I could not have got out of it. It is a great deal
      too bad. But when my aunt has got a fancy in her head, nothing can stop
      her.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      The Honourable John Yates, this new friend, had not much to recommend him
      beyond habits of fashion and expense, and being the younger son of a lord
      with a tolerable independence; and Sir Thomas would probably have thought
      his introduction at Mansfield by no means desirable. Mr. Bertram&rsquo;s
      acquaintance with him had begun at Weymouth, where they had spent ten days
      together in the same society, and the friendship, if friendship it might
      be called, had been proved and perfected by Mr. Yates&rsquo;s being invited to
      take Mansfield in his way, whenever he could, and by his promising to
      come; and he did come rather earlier than had been expected, in
      consequence of the sudden breaking-up of a large party assembled for
      gaiety at the house of another friend, which he had left Weymouth to join.
      He came on the wings of disappointment, and with his head full of acting,
      for it had been a theatrical party; and the play in which he had borne a
      part was within two days of representation, when the sudden death of one
      of the nearest connexions of the family had destroyed the scheme and
      dispersed the performers. To be so near happiness, so near fame, so near
      the long paragraph in praise of the private theatricals at Ecclesford, the
      seat of the Right Hon. Lord Ravenshaw, in Cornwall, which would of course
      have immortalised the whole party for at least a twelvemonth! and being so
      near, to lose it all, was an injury to be keenly felt, and Mr. Yates could
      talk of nothing else. Ecclesford and its theatre, with its arrangements
      and dresses, rehearsals and jokes, was his never-failing subject, and to
      boast of the past his only consolation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Happily for him, a love of the theatre is so general, an itch for acting
      so strong among young people, that he could hardly out-talk the interest
      of his hearers. From the first casting of the parts to the epilogue it was
      all bewitching, and there were few who did not wish to have been a party
      concerned, or would have hesitated to try their skill. The play had been
      Lovers&rsquo; Vows, and Mr. Yates was to have been Count Cassel. &ldquo;A trifling
      part,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and not at all to my taste, and such a one as I certainly
      would not accept again; but I was determined to make no difficulties. Lord
      Ravenshaw and the duke had appropriated the only two characters worth
      playing before I reached Ecclesford; and though Lord Ravenshaw offered to
      resign his to me, it was impossible to take it, you know. I was sorry for
      <i>him</i> that he should have so mistaken his powers, for he was no more
      equal to the Baron&mdash;a little man with a weak voice, always hoarse
      after the first ten minutes. It must have injured the piece materially;
      but <i>I</i> was resolved to make no difficulties. Sir Henry thought the
      duke not equal to Frederick, but that was because Sir Henry wanted the
      part himself; whereas it was certainly in the best hands of the two. I was
      surprised to see Sir Henry such a stick. Luckily the strength of the piece
      did not depend upon him. Our Agatha was inimitable, and the duke was
      thought very great by many. And upon the whole, it would certainly have
      gone off wonderfully.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was a hard case, upon my word&rdquo;; and, &ldquo;I do think you were very much to
      be pitied,&rdquo; were the kind responses of listening sympathy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not worth complaining about; but to be sure the poor old dowager
      could not have died at a worse time; and it is impossible to help wishing
      that the news could have been suppressed for just the three days we
      wanted. It was but three days; and being only a grandmother, and all
      happening two hundred miles off, I think there would have been no great
      harm, and it was suggested, I know; but Lord Ravenshaw, who I suppose is
      one of the most correct men in England, would not hear of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An afterpiece instead of a comedy,&rdquo; said Mr. Bertram. &ldquo;Lovers&rsquo; Vows were
      at an end, and Lord and Lady Ravenshaw left to act My Grandmother by
      themselves. Well, the jointure may comfort <i>him</i>; and perhaps,
      between friends, he began to tremble for his credit and his lungs in the
      Baron, and was not sorry to withdraw; and to make <i>you</i> amends,
      Yates, I think we must raise a little theatre at Mansfield, and ask you to
      be our manager.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This, though the thought of the moment, did not end with the moment; for
      the inclination to act was awakened, and in no one more strongly than in
      him who was now master of the house; and who, having so much leisure as to
      make almost any novelty a certain good, had likewise such a degree of
      lively talents and comic taste, as were exactly adapted to the novelty of
      acting. The thought returned again and again. &ldquo;Oh for the Ecclesford
      theatre and scenery to try something with.&rdquo; Each sister could echo the
      wish; and Henry Crawford, to whom, in all the riot of his gratifications
      it was yet an untasted pleasure, was quite alive at the idea. &ldquo;I really
      believe,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I could be fool enough at this moment to undertake any
      character that ever was written, from Shylock or Richard III down to the
      singing hero of a farce in his scarlet coat and cocked hat. I feel as if I
      could be anything or everything; as if I could rant and storm, or sigh or
      cut capers, in any tragedy or comedy in the English language. Let us be
      doing something. Be it only half a play, an act, a scene; what should
      prevent us? Not these countenances, I am sure,&rdquo; looking towards the Miss
      Bertrams; &ldquo;and for a theatre, what signifies a theatre? We shall be only
      amusing ourselves. Any room in this house might suffice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must have a curtain,&rdquo; said Tom Bertram; &ldquo;a few yards of green baize
      for a curtain, and perhaps that may be enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, quite enough,&rdquo; cried Mr. Yates, &ldquo;with only just a side wing or two
      run up, doors in flat, and three or four scenes to be let down; nothing
      more would be necessary on such a plan as this. For mere amusement among
      ourselves we should want nothing more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe we must be satisfied with <i>less</i>,&rdquo; said Maria. &ldquo;There
      would not be time, and other difficulties would arise. We must rather
      adopt Mr. Crawford&rsquo;s views, and make the <i>performance</i>, not the <i>theatre</i>,
      our object. Many parts of our best plays are independent of scenery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; said Edmund, who began to listen with alarm. &ldquo;Let us do nothing by
      halves. If we are to act, let it be in a theatre completely fitted up with
      pit, boxes, and gallery, and let us have a play entire from beginning to
      end; so as it be a German play, no matter what, with a good tricking,
      shifting afterpiece, and a figure-dance, and a hornpipe, and a song
      between the acts. If we do not outdo Ecclesford, we do nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Edmund, do not be disagreeable,&rdquo; said Julia. &ldquo;Nobody loves a play
      better than you do, or can have gone much farther to see one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True, to see real acting, good hardened real acting; but I would hardly
      walk from this room to the next to look at the raw efforts of those who
      have not been bred to the trade: a set of gentlemen and ladies, who have
      all the disadvantages of education and decorum to struggle through.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After a short pause, however, the subject still continued, and was
      discussed with unabated eagerness, every one&rsquo;s inclination increasing by
      the discussion, and a knowledge of the inclination of the rest; and though
      nothing was settled but that Tom Bertram would prefer a comedy, and his
      sisters and Henry Crawford a tragedy, and that nothing in the world could
      be easier than to find a piece which would please them all, the resolution
      to act something or other seemed so decided as to make Edmund quite
      uncomfortable. He was determined to prevent it, if possible, though his
      mother, who equally heard the conversation which passed at table, did not
      evince the least disapprobation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The same evening afforded him an opportunity of trying his strength.
      Maria, Julia, Henry Crawford, and Mr. Yates were in the billiard-room.
      Tom, returning from them into the drawing-room, where Edmund was standing
      thoughtfully by the fire, while Lady Bertram was on the sofa at a little
      distance, and Fanny close beside her arranging her work, thus began as he
      entered&mdash;&ldquo;Such a horribly vile billiard-table as ours is not to be
      met with, I believe, above ground. I can stand it no longer, and I think,
      I may say, that nothing shall ever tempt me to it again; but one good
      thing I have just ascertained: it is the very room for a theatre,
      precisely the shape and length for it; and the doors at the farther end,
      communicating with each other, as they may be made to do in five minutes,
      by merely moving the bookcase in my father&rsquo;s room, is the very thing we
      could have desired, if we had sat down to wish for it; and my father&rsquo;s
      room will be an excellent greenroom. It seems to join the billiard-room on
      purpose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not serious, Tom, in meaning to act?&rdquo; said Edmund, in a low
      voice, as his brother approached the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not serious! never more so, I assure you. What is there to surprise you
      in it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think it would be very wrong. In a <i>general</i> light, private
      theatricals are open to some objections, but as <i>we</i> are
      circumstanced, I must think it would be highly injudicious, and more than
      injudicious to attempt anything of the kind. It would shew great want of
      feeling on my father&rsquo;s account, absent as he is, and in some degree of
      constant danger; and it would be imprudent, I think, with regard to Maria,
      whose situation is a very delicate one, considering everything, extremely
      delicate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You take up a thing so seriously! as if we were going to act three times
      a week till my father&rsquo;s return, and invite all the country. But it is not
      to be a display of that sort. We mean nothing but a little amusement among
      ourselves, just to vary the scene, and exercise our powers in something
      new. We want no audience, no publicity. We may be trusted, I think, in
      chusing some play most perfectly unexceptionable; and I can conceive no
      greater harm or danger to any of us in conversing in the elegant written
      language of some respectable author than in chattering in words of our
      own. I have no fears and no scruples. And as to my father&rsquo;s being absent,
      it is so far from an objection, that I consider it rather as a motive; for
      the expectation of his return must be a very anxious period to my mother;
      and if we can be the means of amusing that anxiety, and keeping up her
      spirits for the next few weeks, I shall think our time very well spent,
      and so, I am sure, will he. It is a <i>very</i> anxious period for her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he said this, each looked towards their mother. Lady Bertram, sunk back
      in one corner of the sofa, the picture of health, wealth, ease, and
      tranquillity, was just falling into a gentle doze, while Fanny was getting
      through the few difficulties of her work for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Edmund smiled and shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Jove! this won&rsquo;t do,&rdquo; cried Tom, throwing himself into a chair with a
      hearty laugh. &ldquo;To be sure, my dear mother, your anxiety&mdash;I was
      unlucky there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the matter?&rdquo; asked her ladyship, in the heavy tone of one
      half-roused; &ldquo;I was not asleep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh dear, no, ma&rsquo;am, nobody suspected you! Well, Edmund,&rdquo; he continued,
      returning to the former subject, posture, and voice, as soon as Lady
      Bertram began to nod again, &ldquo;but <i>this</i> I <i>will</i> maintain, that
      we shall be doing no harm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot agree with you; I am convinced that my father would totally
      disapprove it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I am convinced to the contrary. Nobody is fonder of the exercise of
      talent in young people, or promotes it more, than my father, and for
      anything of the acting, spouting, reciting kind, I think he has always a
      decided taste. I am sure he encouraged it in us as boys. How many a time
      have we mourned over the dead body of Julius Caesar, and to <i>be&rsquo;d</i>
      and not <i>to</i> <i>be&rsquo;d</i>, in this very room, for his amusement? And I
      am sure, <i>my</i> <i>name</i> <i>was</i> <i>Norval</i>, every evening of
      my life through one Christmas holidays.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was a very different thing. You must see the difference yourself. My
      father wished us, as schoolboys, to speak well, but he would never wish
      his grown-up daughters to be acting plays. His sense of decorum is
      strict.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know all that,&rdquo; said Tom, displeased. &ldquo;I know my father as well as you
      do; and I&rsquo;ll take care that his daughters do nothing to distress him.
      Manage your own concerns, Edmund, and I&rsquo;ll take care of the rest of the
      family.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you are resolved on acting,&rdquo; replied the persevering Edmund, &ldquo;I must
      hope it will be in a very small and quiet way; and I think a theatre ought
      not to be attempted. It would be taking liberties with my father&rsquo;s house
      in his absence which could not be justified.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For everything of that nature I will be answerable,&rdquo; said Tom, in a
      decided tone. &ldquo;His house shall not be hurt. I have quite as great an
      interest in being careful of his house as you can have; and as to such
      alterations as I was suggesting just now, such as moving a bookcase, or
      unlocking a door, or even as using the billiard-room for the space of a
      week without playing at billiards in it, you might just as well suppose he
      would object to our sitting more in this room, and less in the
      breakfast-room, than we did before he went away, or to my sister&rsquo;s
      pianoforte being moved from one side of the room to the other. Absolute
      nonsense!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The innovation, if not wrong as an innovation, will be wrong as an
      expense.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, the expense of such an undertaking would be prodigious! Perhaps it
      might cost a whole twenty pounds. Something of a theatre we must have
      undoubtedly, but it will be on the simplest plan: a green curtain and a
      little carpenter&rsquo;s work, and that&rsquo;s all; and as the carpenter&rsquo;s work may
      be all done at home by Christopher Jackson himself, it will be too absurd
      to talk of expense; and as long as Jackson is employed, everything will be
      right with Sir Thomas. Don&rsquo;t imagine that nobody in this house can see or
      judge but yourself. Don&rsquo;t act yourself, if you do not like it, but don&rsquo;t
      expect to govern everybody else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, as to acting myself,&rdquo; said Edmund, &ldquo;<i>that</i> I absolutely protest
      against.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tom walked out of the room as he said it, and Edmund was left to sit down
      and stir the fire in thoughtful vexation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fanny, who had heard it all, and borne Edmund company in every feeling
      throughout the whole, now ventured to say, in her anxiety to suggest some
      comfort, &ldquo;Perhaps they may not be able to find any play to suit them. Your
      brother&rsquo;s taste and your sisters&rsquo; seem very different.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no hope there, Fanny. If they persist in the scheme, they will
      find something. I shall speak to my sisters and try to dissuade <i>them</i>,
      and that is all I can do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think my aunt Norris would be on your side.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare say she would, but she has no influence with either Tom or my
      sisters that could be of any use; and if I cannot convince them myself, I
      shall let things take their course, without attempting it through her.
      Family squabbling is the greatest evil of all, and we had better do
      anything than be altogether by the ears.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His sisters, to whom he had an opportunity of speaking the next morning,
      were quite as impatient of his advice, quite as unyielding to his
      representation, quite as determined in the cause of pleasure, as Tom.
      Their mother had no objection to the plan, and they were not in the least
      afraid of their father&rsquo;s disapprobation. There could be no harm in what
      had been done in so many respectable families, and by so many women of the
      first consideration; and it must be scrupulousness run mad that could see
      anything to censure in a plan like theirs, comprehending only brothers and
      sisters and intimate friends, and which would never be heard of beyond
      themselves. Julia <i>did</i> seem inclined to admit that Maria&rsquo;s situation
      might require particular caution and delicacy&mdash;but that could not
      extend to <i>her</i>&mdash;she was at liberty; and Maria evidently
      considered her engagement as only raising her so much more above
      restraint, and leaving her less occasion than Julia to consult either
      father or mother. Edmund had little to hope, but he was still urging the
      subject when Henry Crawford entered the room, fresh from the Parsonage,
      calling out, &ldquo;No want of hands in our theatre, Miss Bertram. No want of
      understrappers: my sister desires her love, and hopes to be admitted into
      the company, and will be happy to take the part of any old duenna or tame
      confidante, that you may not like to do yourselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Maria gave Edmund a glance, which meant, &ldquo;What say you now? Can we be
      wrong if Mary Crawford feels the same?&rdquo; And Edmund, silenced, was obliged
      to acknowledge that the charm of acting might well carry fascination to
      the mind of genius; and with the ingenuity of love, to dwell more on the
      obliging, accommodating purport of the message than on anything else.
    </p>
    <p>
      The scheme advanced. Opposition was vain; and as to Mrs. Norris, he was
      mistaken in supposing she would wish to make any. She started no
      difficulties that were not talked down in five minutes by her eldest
      nephew and niece, who were all-powerful with her; and as the whole
      arrangement was to bring very little expense to anybody, and none at all
      to herself, as she foresaw in it all the comforts of hurry, bustle, and
      importance, and derived the immediate advantage of fancying herself
      obliged to leave her own house, where she had been living a month at her
      own cost, and take up her abode in theirs, that every hour might be spent
      in their service, she was, in fact, exceedingly delighted with the
      project.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIV
    </h2>
    <p>
      Fanny seemed nearer being right than Edmund had supposed. The business of
      finding a play that would suit everybody proved to be no trifle; and the
      carpenter had received his orders and taken his measurements, had
      suggested and removed at least two sets of difficulties, and having made
      the necessity of an enlargement of plan and expense fully evident, was
      already at work, while a play was still to seek. Other preparations were
      also in hand. An enormous roll of green baize had arrived from
      Northampton, and been cut out by Mrs. Norris (with a saving by her good
      management of full three-quarters of a yard), and was actually forming
      into a curtain by the housemaids, and still the play was wanting; and as
      two or three days passed away in this manner, Edmund began almost to hope
      that none might ever be found.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were, in fact, so many things to be attended to, so many people to
      be pleased, so many best characters required, and, above all, such a need
      that the play should be at once both tragedy and comedy, that there did
      seem as little chance of a decision as anything pursued by youth and zeal
      could hold out.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the tragic side were the Miss Bertrams, Henry Crawford, and Mr. Yates;
      on the comic, Tom Bertram, not <i>quite</i> alone, because it was evident
      that Mary Crawford&rsquo;s wishes, though politely kept back, inclined the same
      way: but his determinateness and his power seemed to make allies
      unnecessary; and, independent of this great irreconcilable difference,
      they wanted a piece containing very few characters in the whole, but every
      character first-rate, and three principal women. All the best plays were
      run over in vain. Neither Hamlet, nor Macbeth, nor Othello, nor Douglas,
      nor The Gamester, presented anything that could satisfy even the
      tragedians; and The Rivals, The School for Scandal, Wheel of Fortune, Heir
      at Law, and a long et cetera, were successively dismissed with yet warmer
      objections. No piece could be proposed that did not supply somebody with a
      difficulty, and on one side or the other it was a continual repetition of,
      &ldquo;Oh no, <i>that</i> will never do! Let us have no ranting tragedies. Too
      many characters. Not a tolerable woman&rsquo;s part in the play. Anything but <i>that</i>,
      my dear Tom. It would be impossible to fill it up. One could not expect
      anybody to take such a part. Nothing but buffoonery from beginning to end.
      <i>That</i> might do, perhaps, but for the low parts. If I <i>must</i>
      give my opinion, I have always thought it the most insipid play in the
      English language. <i>I</i> do not wish to make objections; I shall be
      happy to be of any use, but I think we could not chuse worse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fanny looked on and listened, not unamused to observe the selfishness
      which, more or less disguised, seemed to govern them all, and wondering
      how it would end. For her own gratification she could have wished that
      something might be acted, for she had never seen even half a play, but
      everything of higher consequence was against it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This will never do,&rdquo; said Tom Bertram at last. &ldquo;We are wasting time most
      abominably. Something must be fixed on. No matter what, so that something
      is chosen. We must not be so nice. A few characters too many must not
      frighten us. We must <i>double</i> them. We must descend a little. If a
      part is insignificant, the greater our credit in making anything of it.
      From this moment I make no difficulties. I take any part you chuse to give
      me, so as it be comic. Let it but be comic, I condition for nothing more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For about the fifth time he then proposed the Heir at Law, doubting only
      whether to prefer Lord Duberley or Dr. Pangloss for himself; and very
      earnestly, but very unsuccessfully, trying to persuade the others that
      there were some fine tragic parts in the rest of the dramatis personae.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pause which followed this fruitless effort was ended by the same
      speaker, who, taking up one of the many volumes of plays that lay on the
      table, and turning it over, suddenly exclaimed&mdash;&ldquo;Lovers&rsquo; Vows! And
      why should not Lovers&rsquo; Vows do for <i>us</i> as well as for the
      Ravenshaws? How came it never to be thought of before? It strikes me as if
      it would do exactly. What say you all? Here are two capital tragic parts
      for Yates and Crawford, and here is the rhyming Butler for me, if nobody
      else wants it; a trifling part, but the sort of thing I should not
      dislike, and, as I said before, I am determined to take anything and do my
      best. And as for the rest, they may be filled up by anybody. It is only
      Count Cassel and Anhalt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The suggestion was generally welcome. Everybody was growing weary of
      indecision, and the first idea with everybody was, that nothing had been
      proposed before so likely to suit them all. Mr. Yates was particularly
      pleased: he had been sighing and longing to do the Baron at Ecclesford,
      had grudged every rant of Lord Ravenshaw&rsquo;s, and been forced to re-rant it
      all in his own room. The storm through Baron Wildenheim was the height of
      his theatrical ambition; and with the advantage of knowing half the scenes
      by heart already, he did now, with the greatest alacrity, offer his
      services for the part. To do him justice, however, he did not resolve to
      appropriate it; for remembering that there was some very good
      ranting-ground in Frederick, he professed an equal willingness for that.
      Henry Crawford was ready to take either. Whichever Mr. Yates did not chuse
      would perfectly satisfy him, and a short parley of compliment ensued. Miss
      Bertram, feeling all the interest of an Agatha in the question, took on
      her to decide it, by observing to Mr. Yates that this was a point in which
      height and figure ought to be considered, and that <i>his</i> being the
      tallest, seemed to fit him peculiarly for the Baron. She was acknowledged
      to be quite right, and the two parts being accepted accordingly, she was
      certain of the proper Frederick. Three of the characters were now cast,
      besides Mr. Rushworth, who was always answered for by Maria as willing to
      do anything; when Julia, meaning, like her sister, to be Agatha, began to
      be scrupulous on Miss Crawford&rsquo;s account.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is not behaving well by the absent,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;Here are not women
      enough. Amelia and Agatha may do for Maria and me, but here is nothing for
      your sister, Mr. Crawford.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Crawford desired <i>that</i> might not be thought of: he was very sure
      his sister had no wish of acting but as she might be useful, and that she
      would not allow herself to be considered in the present case. But this was
      immediately opposed by Tom Bertram, who asserted the part of Amelia to be
      in every respect the property of Miss Crawford, if she would accept it.
      &ldquo;It falls as naturally, as necessarily to her,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;as Agatha does
      to one or other of my sisters. It can be no sacrifice on their side, for
      it is highly comic.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A short silence followed. Each sister looked anxious; for each felt the
      best claim to Agatha, and was hoping to have it pressed on her by the
      rest. Henry Crawford, who meanwhile had taken up the play, and with
      seeming carelessness was turning over the first act, soon settled the
      business.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must entreat Miss <i>Julia</i> Bertram,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;not to engage in the
      part of Agatha, or it will be the ruin of all my solemnity. You must not,
      indeed you must not&rdquo; (turning to her). &ldquo;I could not stand your countenance
      dressed up in woe and paleness. The many laughs we have had together would
      infallibly come across me, and Frederick and his knapsack would be obliged
      to run away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pleasantly, courteously, it was spoken; but the manner was lost in the
      matter to Julia&rsquo;s feelings. She saw a glance at Maria which confirmed the
      injury to herself: it was a scheme, a trick; she was slighted, Maria was
      preferred; the smile of triumph which Maria was trying to suppress shewed
      how well it was understood; and before Julia could command herself enough
      to speak, her brother gave his weight against her too, by saying, &ldquo;Oh yes!
      Maria must be Agatha. Maria will be the best Agatha. Though Julia fancies
      she prefers tragedy, I would not trust her in it. There is nothing of
      tragedy about her. She has not the look of it. Her features are not tragic
      features, and she walks too quick, and speaks too quick, and would not
      keep her countenance. She had better do the old countrywoman: the
      Cottager&rsquo;s wife; you had, indeed, Julia. Cottager&rsquo;s wife is a very pretty
      part, I assure you. The old lady relieves the high-flown benevolence of
      her husband with a good deal of spirit. You shall be Cottager&rsquo;s wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cottager&rsquo;s wife!&rdquo; cried Mr. Yates. &ldquo;What are you talking of? The most
      trivial, paltry, insignificant part; the merest commonplace; not a
      tolerable speech in the whole. Your sister do that! It is an insult to
      propose it. At Ecclesford the governess was to have done it. We all agreed
      that it could not be offered to anybody else. A little more justice, Mr.
      Manager, if you please. You do not deserve the office, if you cannot
      appreciate the talents of your company a little better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, as to <i>that</i>, my good friend, till I and my company have really
      acted there must be some guesswork; but I mean no disparagement to Julia.
      We cannot have two Agathas, and we must have one Cottager&rsquo;s wife; and I am
      sure I set her the example of moderation myself in being satisfied with
      the old Butler. If the part is trifling she will have more credit in
      making something of it; and if she is so desperately bent against
      everything humorous, let her take Cottager&rsquo;s speeches instead of
      Cottager&rsquo;s wife&rsquo;s, and so change the parts all through; <i>he</i> is
      solemn and pathetic enough, I am sure. It could make no difference in the
      play, and as for Cottager himself, when he has got his wife&rsquo;s speeches, <i>I</i>
      would undertake him with all my heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With all your partiality for Cottager&rsquo;s wife,&rdquo; said Henry Crawford, &ldquo;it
      will be impossible to make anything of it fit for your sister, and we must
      not suffer her good-nature to be imposed on. We must not <i>allow</i> her
      to accept the part. She must not be left to her own complaisance. Her
      talents will be wanted in Amelia. Amelia is a character more difficult to
      be well represented than even Agatha. I consider Amelia is the most
      difficult character in the whole piece. It requires great powers, great
      nicety, to give her playfulness and simplicity without extravagance. I
      have seen good actresses fail in the part. Simplicity, indeed, is beyond
      the reach of almost every actress by profession. It requires a delicacy of
      feeling which they have not. It requires a gentlewoman&mdash;a Julia
      Bertram. You <i>will</i> undertake it, I hope?&rdquo; turning to her with a look
      of anxious entreaty, which softened her a little; but while she hesitated
      what to say, her brother again interposed with Miss Crawford&rsquo;s better
      claim.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, Julia must not be Amelia. It is not at all the part for her. She
      would not like it. She would not do well. She is too tall and robust.
      Amelia should be a small, light, girlish, skipping figure. It is fit for
      Miss Crawford, and Miss Crawford only. She looks the part, and I am
      persuaded will do it admirably.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Without attending to this, Henry Crawford continued his supplication. &ldquo;You
      must oblige us,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;indeed you must. When you have studied the
      character, I am sure you will feel it suit you. Tragedy may be your
      choice, but it will certainly appear that comedy chuses <i>you</i>. You
      will be to visit me in prison with a basket of provisions; you will not
      refuse to visit me in prison? I think I see you coming in with your
      basket.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The influence of his voice was felt. Julia wavered; but was he only trying
      to soothe and pacify her, and make her overlook the previous affront? She
      distrusted him. The slight had been most determined. He was, perhaps, but
      at treacherous play with her. She looked suspiciously at her sister;
      Maria&rsquo;s countenance was to decide it: if she were vexed and alarmed&mdash;but
      Maria looked all serenity and satisfaction, and Julia well knew that on
      this ground Maria could not be happy but at her expense. With hasty
      indignation, therefore, and a tremulous voice, she said to him, &ldquo;You do
      not seem afraid of not keeping your countenance when I come in with a
      basket of provisions&mdash;though one might have supposed&mdash;but it is
      only as Agatha that I was to be so overpowering!&rdquo; She stopped&mdash;Henry
      Crawford looked rather foolish, and as if he did not know what to say. Tom
      Bertram began again&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Crawford must be Amelia. She will be an excellent Amelia.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not be afraid of <i>my</i> wanting the character,&rdquo; cried Julia, with
      angry quickness: &ldquo;I am <i>not</i> to be Agatha, and I am sure I will do
      nothing else; and as to Amelia, it is of all parts in the world the most
      disgusting to me. I quite detest her. An odious, little, pert, unnatural,
      impudent girl. I have always protested against comedy, and this is comedy
      in its worst form.&rdquo; And so saying, she walked hastily out of the room,
      leaving awkward feelings to more than one, but exciting small compassion
      in any except Fanny, who had been a quiet auditor of the whole, and who
      could not think of her as under the agitations of <i>jealousy</i> without
      great pity.
    </p>
    <p>
      A short silence succeeded her leaving them; but her brother soon returned
      to business and Lovers&rsquo; Vows, and was eagerly looking over the play, with
      Mr. Yates&rsquo;s help, to ascertain what scenery would be necessary&mdash;while
      Maria and Henry Crawford conversed together in an under-voice, and the
      declaration with which she began of, &ldquo;I am sure I would give up the part
      to Julia most willingly, but that though I shall probably do it very ill,
      I feel persuaded <i>she</i> would do it worse,&rdquo; was doubtless receiving
      all the compliments it called for.
    </p>
    <p>
      When this had lasted some time, the division of the party was completed by
      Tom Bertram and Mr. Yates walking off together to consult farther in the
      room now beginning to be called <i>the</i> <i>Theatre</i>, and Miss
      Bertram&rsquo;s resolving to go down to the Parsonage herself with the offer of
      Amelia to Miss Crawford; and Fanny remained alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first use she made of her solitude was to take up the volume which had
      been left on the table, and begin to acquaint herself with the play of
      which she had heard so much. Her curiosity was all awake, and she ran
      through it with an eagerness which was suspended only by intervals of
      astonishment, that it could be chosen in the present instance, that it
      could be proposed and accepted in a private theatre! Agatha and Amelia
      appeared to her in their different ways so totally improper for home
      representation&mdash;the situation of one, and the language of the other,
      so unfit to be expressed by any woman of modesty, that she could hardly
      suppose her cousins could be aware of what they were engaging in; and
      longed to have them roused as soon as possible by the remonstrance which
      Edmund would certainly make.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XV
    </h2>
    <p>
      Miss Crawford accepted the part very readily; and soon after Miss
      Bertram&rsquo;s return from the Parsonage, Mr. Rushworth arrived, and another
      character was consequently cast. He had the offer of Count Cassel and
      Anhalt, and at first did not know which to chuse, and wanted Miss Bertram
      to direct him; but upon being made to understand the different style of
      the characters, and which was which, and recollecting that he had once
      seen the play in London, and had thought Anhalt a very stupid fellow, he
      soon decided for the Count. Miss Bertram approved the decision, for the
      less he had to learn the better; and though she could not sympathise in
      his wish that the Count and Agatha might be to act together, nor wait very
      patiently while he was slowly turning over the leaves with the hope of
      still discovering such a scene, she very kindly took his part in hand, and
      curtailed every speech that admitted being shortened; besides pointing out
      the necessity of his being very much dressed, and chusing his colours. Mr.
      Rushworth liked the idea of his finery very well, though affecting to
      despise it; and was too much engaged with what his own appearance would be
      to think of the others, or draw any of those conclusions, or feel any of
      that displeasure which Maria had been half prepared for.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus much was settled before Edmund, who had been out all the morning,
      knew anything of the matter; but when he entered the drawing-room before
      dinner, the buzz of discussion was high between Tom, Maria, and Mr. Yates;
      and Mr. Rushworth stepped forward with great alacrity to tell him the
      agreeable news.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have got a play,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;It is to be Lovers&rsquo; Vows; and I am to be
      Count Cassel, and am to come in first with a blue dress and a pink satin
      cloak, and afterwards am to have another fine fancy suit, by way of a
      shooting-dress. I do not know how I shall like it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fanny&rsquo;s eyes followed Edmund, and her heart beat for him as she heard this
      speech, and saw his look, and felt what his sensations must be.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lovers&rsquo; Vows!&rdquo; in a tone of the greatest amazement, was his only reply to
      Mr. Rushworth, and he turned towards his brother and sisters as if hardly
      doubting a contradiction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; cried Mr. Yates. &ldquo;After all our debatings and difficulties, we find
      there is nothing that will suit us altogether so well, nothing so
      unexceptionable, as Lovers&rsquo; Vows. The wonder is that it should not have
      been thought of before. My stupidity was abominable, for here we have all
      the advantage of what I saw at Ecclesford; and it is so useful to have
      anything of a model! We have cast almost every part.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what do you do for women?&rdquo; said Edmund gravely, and looking at Maria.
    </p>
    <p>
      Maria blushed in spite of herself as she answered, &ldquo;I take the part which
      Lady Ravenshaw was to have done, and&rdquo; (with a bolder eye) &ldquo;Miss Crawford
      is to be Amelia.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should not have thought it the sort of play to be so easily filled up,
      with <i>us</i>,&rdquo; replied Edmund, turning away to the fire, where sat his
      mother, aunt, and Fanny, and seating himself with a look of great
      vexation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Rushworth followed him to say, &ldquo;I come in three times, and have
      two-and-forty speeches. That&rsquo;s something, is not it? But I do not much
      like the idea of being so fine. I shall hardly know myself in a blue dress
      and a pink satin cloak.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Edmund could not answer him. In a few minutes Mr. Bertram was called out
      of the room to satisfy some doubts of the carpenter; and being accompanied
      by Mr. Yates, and followed soon afterwards by Mr. Rushworth, Edmund almost
      immediately took the opportunity of saying, &ldquo;I cannot, before Mr. Yates,
      speak what I feel as to this play, without reflecting on his friends at
      Ecclesford; but I must now, my dear Maria, tell <i>you</i>, that I think
      it exceedingly unfit for private representation, and that I hope you will
      give it up. I cannot but suppose you <i>will</i> when you have read it
      carefully over. Read only the first act aloud to either your mother or
      aunt, and see how you can approve it. It will not be necessary to send you
      to your <i>father&rsquo;s</i> judgment, I am convinced.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We see things very differently,&rdquo; cried Maria. &ldquo;I am perfectly acquainted
      with the play, I assure you; and with a very few omissions, and so forth,
      which will be made, of course, I can see nothing objectionable in it; and
      <i>I</i> am not the <i>only</i> young woman you find who thinks it very
      fit for private representation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry for it,&rdquo; was his answer; &ldquo;but in this matter it is <i>you</i>
      who are to lead. <i>You</i> must set the example. If others have
      blundered, it is your place to put them right, and shew them what true
      delicacy is. In all points of decorum <i>your</i> conduct must be law to
      the rest of the party.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This picture of her consequence had some effect, for no one loved better
      to lead than Maria; and with far more good-humour she answered, &ldquo;I am much
      obliged to you, Edmund; you mean very well, I am sure: but I still think
      you see things too strongly; and I really cannot undertake to harangue all
      the rest upon a subject of this kind. <i>There</i> would be the greatest
      indecorum, I think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you imagine that I could have such an idea in my head? No; let your
      conduct be the only harangue. Say that, on examining the part, you feel
      yourself unequal to it; that you find it requiring more exertion and
      confidence than you can be supposed to have. Say this with firmness, and
      it will be quite enough. All who can distinguish will understand your
      motive. The play will be given up, and your delicacy honoured as it
      ought.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not act anything improper, my dear,&rdquo; said Lady Bertram. &ldquo;Sir Thomas
      would not like it.&mdash;Fanny, ring the bell; I must have my dinner.&mdash;To
      be sure, Julia is dressed by this time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am convinced, madam,&rdquo; said Edmund, preventing Fanny, &ldquo;that Sir Thomas
      would not like it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, my dear, do you hear what Edmund says?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I were to decline the part,&rdquo; said Maria, with renewed zeal, &ldquo;Julia
      would certainly take it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; cried Edmund, &ldquo;if she knew your reasons!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! she might think the difference between us&mdash;the difference in our
      situations&mdash;that <i>she</i> need not be so scrupulous as <i>I</i>
      might feel necessary. I am sure she would argue so. No; you must excuse
      me; I cannot retract my consent; it is too far settled, everybody would be
      so disappointed, Tom would be quite angry; and if we are so very nice, we
      shall never act anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was just going to say the very same thing,&rdquo; said Mrs. Norris. &ldquo;If every
      play is to be objected to, you will act nothing, and the preparations will
      be all so much money thrown away, and I am sure <i>that</i> would be a
      discredit to us all. I do not know the play; but, as Maria says, if there
      is anything a little too warm (and it is so with most of them) it can be
      easily left out. We must not be over-precise, Edmund. As Mr. Rushworth is
      to act too, there can be no harm. I only wish Tom had known his own mind
      when the carpenters began, for there was the loss of half a day&rsquo;s work
      about those side-doors. The curtain will be a good job, however. The maids
      do their work very well, and I think we shall be able to send back some
      dozens of the rings. There is no occasion to put them so very close
      together. I <i>am</i> of some use, I hope, in preventing waste and making
      the most of things. There should always be one steady head to superintend
      so many young ones. I forgot to tell Tom of something that happened to me
      this very day. I had been looking about me in the poultry-yard, and was
      just coming out, when who should I see but Dick Jackson making up to the
      servants&rsquo; hall-door with two bits of deal board in his hand, bringing them
      to father, you may be sure; mother had chanced to send him of a message to
      father, and then father had bid him bring up them two bits of board, for
      he could not no how do without them. I knew what all this meant, for the
      servants&rsquo; dinner-bell was ringing at the very moment over our heads; and
      as I hate such encroaching people (the Jacksons are very encroaching, I
      have always said so: just the sort of people to get all they can), I said
      to the boy directly (a great lubberly fellow of ten years old, you know,
      who ought to be ashamed of himself), &lsquo;<i>I&rsquo;ll</i> take the boards to your
      father, Dick, so get you home again as fast as you can.&rsquo; The boy looked
      very silly, and turned away without offering a word, for I believe I might
      speak pretty sharp; and I dare say it will cure him of coming marauding
      about the house for one while. I hate such greediness&mdash;so good as
      your father is to the family, employing the man all the year round!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nobody was at the trouble of an answer; the others soon returned; and
      Edmund found that to have endeavoured to set them right must be his only
      satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dinner passed heavily. Mrs. Norris related again her triumph over Dick
      Jackson, but neither play nor preparation were otherwise much talked of,
      for Edmund&rsquo;s disapprobation was felt even by his brother, though he would
      not have owned it. Maria, wanting Henry Crawford&rsquo;s animating support,
      thought the subject better avoided. Mr. Yates, who was trying to make
      himself agreeable to Julia, found her gloom less impenetrable on any topic
      than that of his regret at her secession from their company; and Mr.
      Rushworth, having only his own part and his own dress in his head, had
      soon talked away all that could be said of either.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the concerns of the theatre were suspended only for an hour or two:
      there was still a great deal to be settled; and the spirits of evening
      giving fresh courage, Tom, Maria, and Mr. Yates, soon after their being
      reassembled in the drawing-room, seated themselves in committee at a
      separate table, with the play open before them, and were just getting deep
      in the subject when a most welcome interruption was given by the entrance
      of Mr. and Miss Crawford, who, late and dark and dirty as it was, could
      not help coming, and were received with the most grateful joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, how do you go on?&rdquo; and &ldquo;What have you settled?&rdquo; and &ldquo;Oh! we can do
      nothing without you,&rdquo; followed the first salutations; and Henry Crawford
      was soon seated with the other three at the table, while his sister made
      her way to Lady Bertram, and with pleasant attention was complimenting <i>her</i>.
      &ldquo;I must really congratulate your ladyship,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;on the play being
      chosen; for though you have borne it with exemplary patience, I am sure
      you must be sick of all our noise and difficulties. The actors may be
      glad, but the bystanders must be infinitely more thankful for a decision;
      and I do sincerely give you joy, madam, as well as Mrs. Norris, and
      everybody else who is in the same predicament,&rdquo; glancing half fearfully,
      half slyly, beyond Fanny to Edmund.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was very civilly answered by Lady Bertram, but Edmund said nothing.
      His being only a bystander was not disclaimed. After continuing in chat
      with the party round the fire a few minutes, Miss Crawford returned to the
      party round the table; and standing by them, seemed to interest herself in
      their arrangements till, as if struck by a sudden recollection, she
      exclaimed, &ldquo;My good friends, you are most composedly at work upon these
      cottages and alehouses, inside and out; but pray let me know my fate in
      the meanwhile. Who is to be Anhalt? What gentleman among you am I to have
      the pleasure of making love to?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a moment no one spoke; and then many spoke together to tell the same
      melancholy truth, that they had not yet got any Anhalt. &ldquo;Mr. Rushworth was
      to be Count Cassel, but no one had yet undertaken Anhalt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had my choice of the parts,&rdquo; said Mr. Rushworth; &ldquo;but I thought I
      should like the Count best, though I do not much relish the finery I am to
      have.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You chose very wisely, I am sure,&rdquo; replied Miss Crawford, with a
      brightened look; &ldquo;Anhalt is a heavy part.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>The</i> <i>Count</i> has two-and-forty speeches,&rdquo; returned Mr.
      Rushworth, &ldquo;which is no trifle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not at all surprised,&rdquo; said Miss Crawford, after a short pause, &ldquo;at
      this want of an Anhalt. Amelia deserves no better. Such a forward young
      lady may well frighten the men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should be but too happy in taking the part, if it were possible,&rdquo; cried
      Tom; &ldquo;but, unluckily, the Butler and Anhalt are in together. I will not
      entirely give it up, however; I will try what can be done&mdash;I will
      look it over again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your <i>brother</i> should take the part,&rdquo; said Mr. Yates, in a low
      voice. &ldquo;Do not you think he would?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>I</i> shall not ask him,&rdquo; replied Tom, in a cold, determined manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Crawford talked of something else, and soon afterwards rejoined the
      party at the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They do not want me at all,&rdquo; said she, seating herself. &ldquo;I only puzzle
      them, and oblige them to make civil speeches. Mr. Edmund Bertram, as you
      do not act yourself, you will be a disinterested adviser; and, therefore,
      I apply to <i>you</i>. What shall we do for an Anhalt? Is it practicable
      for any of the others to double it? What is your advice?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My advice,&rdquo; said he calmly, &ldquo;is that you change the play.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>I</i> should have no objection,&rdquo; she replied; &ldquo;for though I should not
      particularly dislike the part of Amelia if well supported, that is, if
      everything went well, I shall be sorry to be an inconvenience; but as they
      do not chuse to hear your advice at <i>that</i> <i>table</i>&rdquo; (looking
      round), &ldquo;it certainly will not be taken.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Edmund said no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If <i>any</i> part could tempt <i>you</i> to act, I suppose it would be
      Anhalt,&rdquo; observed the lady archly, after a short pause; &ldquo;for he is a
      clergyman, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>That</i> circumstance would by no means tempt me,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;for I
      should be sorry to make the character ridiculous by bad acting. It must be
      very difficult to keep Anhalt from appearing a formal, solemn lecturer;
      and the man who chuses the profession itself is, perhaps, one of the last
      who would wish to represent it on the stage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Crawford was silenced, and with some feelings of resentment and
      mortification, moved her chair considerably nearer the tea-table, and gave
      all her attention to Mrs. Norris, who was presiding there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fanny,&rdquo; cried Tom Bertram, from the other table, where the conference was
      eagerly carrying on, and the conversation incessant, &ldquo;we want your
      services.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fanny was up in a moment, expecting some errand; for the habit of
      employing her in that way was not yet overcome, in spite of all that
      Edmund could do.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! we do not want to disturb you from your seat. We do not want your <i>present</i>
      services. We shall only want you in our play. You must be Cottager&rsquo;s
      wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me!&rdquo; cried Fanny, sitting down again with a most frightened look. &ldquo;Indeed
      you must excuse me. I could not act anything if you were to give me the
      world. No, indeed, I cannot act.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, but you must, for we cannot excuse you. It need not frighten you:
      it is a nothing of a part, a mere nothing, not above half a dozen speeches
      altogether, and it will not much signify if nobody hears a word you say;
      so you may be as creep-mouse as you like, but we must have you to look
      at.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you are afraid of half a dozen speeches,&rdquo; cried Mr. Rushworth, &ldquo;what
      would you do with such a part as mine? I have forty-two to learn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not that I am afraid of learning by heart,&rdquo; said Fanny, shocked to
      find herself at that moment the only speaker in the room, and to feel that
      almost every eye was upon her; &ldquo;but I really cannot act.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, you can act well enough for <i>us</i>. Learn your part, and we
      will teach you all the rest. You have only two scenes, and as I shall be
      Cottager, I&rsquo;ll put you in and push you about, and you will do it very
      well, I&rsquo;ll answer for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, indeed, Mr. Bertram, you must excuse me. You cannot have an idea. It
      would be absolutely impossible for me. If I were to undertake it, I should
      only disappoint you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Phoo! Phoo! Do not be so shamefaced. You&rsquo;ll do it very well. Every
      allowance will be made for you. We do not expect perfection. You must get
      a brown gown, and a white apron, and a mob cap, and we must make you a few
      wrinkles, and a little of the crowsfoot at the corner of your eyes, and
      you will be a very proper, little old woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must excuse me, indeed you must excuse me,&rdquo; cried Fanny, growing more
      and more red from excessive agitation, and looking distressfully at
      Edmund, who was kindly observing her; but unwilling to exasperate his
      brother by interference, gave her only an encouraging smile. Her entreaty
      had no effect on Tom: he only said again what he had said before; and it
      was not merely Tom, for the requisition was now backed by Maria, and Mr.
      Crawford, and Mr. Yates, with an urgency which differed from his but in
      being more gentle or more ceremonious, and which altogether was quite
      overpowering to Fanny; and before she could breathe after it, Mrs. Norris
      completed the whole by thus addressing her in a whisper at once angry and
      audible&mdash;&ldquo;What a piece of work here is about nothing: I am quite
      ashamed of you, Fanny, to make such a difficulty of obliging your cousins
      in a trifle of this sort&mdash;so kind as they are to you! Take the part
      with a good grace, and let us hear no more of the matter, I entreat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not urge her, madam,&rdquo; said Edmund. &ldquo;It is not fair to urge her in this
      manner. You see she does not like to act. Let her chuse for herself, as
      well as the rest of us. Her judgment may be quite as safely trusted. Do
      not urge her any more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not going to urge her,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Norris sharply; &ldquo;but I shall
      think her a very obstinate, ungrateful girl, if she does not do what her
      aunt and cousins wish her&mdash;very ungrateful, indeed, considering who
      and what she is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Edmund was too angry to speak; but Miss Crawford, looking for a moment
      with astonished eyes at Mrs. Norris, and then at Fanny, whose tears were
      beginning to shew themselves, immediately said, with some keenness, &ldquo;I do
      not like my situation: this <i>place</i> is too hot for me,&rdquo; and moved
      away her chair to the opposite side of the table, close to Fanny, saying
      to her, in a kind, low whisper, as she placed herself, &ldquo;Never mind, my
      dear Miss Price, this is a cross evening: everybody is cross and teasing,
      but do not let us mind them&rdquo;; and with pointed attention continued to talk
      to her and endeavour to raise her spirits, in spite of being out of
      spirits herself. By a look at her brother she prevented any farther
      entreaty from the theatrical board, and the really good feelings by which
      she was almost purely governed were rapidly restoring her to all the
      little she had lost in Edmund&rsquo;s favour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fanny did not love Miss Crawford; but she felt very much obliged to her
      for her present kindness; and when, from taking notice of her work, and
      wishing <i>she</i> could work as well, and begging for the pattern, and
      supposing Fanny was now preparing for her <i>appearance</i>, as of course
      she would come out when her cousin was married, Miss Crawford proceeded to
      inquire if she had heard lately from her brother at sea, and said that she
      had quite a curiosity to see him, and imagined him a very fine young man,
      and advised Fanny to get his picture drawn before he went to sea again&mdash;she
      could not help admitting it to be very agreeable flattery, or help
      listening, and answering with more animation than she had intended.
    </p>
    <p>
      The consultation upon the play still went on, and Miss Crawford&rsquo;s
      attention was first called from Fanny by Tom Bertram&rsquo;s telling her, with
      infinite regret, that he found it absolutely impossible for him to
      undertake the part of Anhalt in addition to the Butler: he had been most
      anxiously trying to make it out to be feasible, but it would not do; he
      must give it up. &ldquo;But there will not be the smallest difficulty in filling
      it,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;We have but to speak the word; we may pick and chuse. I
      could name, at this moment, at least six young men within six miles of us,
      who are wild to be admitted into our company, and there are one or two
      that would not disgrace us: I should not be afraid to trust either of the
      Olivers or Charles Maddox. Tom Oliver is a very clever fellow, and Charles
      Maddox is as gentlemanlike a man as you will see anywhere, so I will take
      my horse early to-morrow morning and ride over to Stoke, and settle with
      one of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While he spoke, Maria was looking apprehensively round at Edmund in full
      expectation that he must oppose such an enlargement of the plan as this:
      so contrary to all their first protestations; but Edmund said nothing.
      After a moment&rsquo;s thought, Miss Crawford calmly replied, &ldquo;As far as I am
      concerned, I can have no objection to anything that you all think
      eligible. Have I ever seen either of the gentlemen? Yes, Mr. Charles
      Maddox dined at my sister&rsquo;s one day, did not he, Henry? A quiet-looking
      young man. I remember him. Let <i>him</i> be applied to, if you please,
      for it will be less unpleasant to me than to have a perfect stranger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Charles Maddox was to be the man. Tom repeated his resolution of going to
      him early on the morrow; and though Julia, who had scarcely opened her
      lips before, observed, in a sarcastic manner, and with a glance first at
      Maria and then at Edmund, that &ldquo;the Mansfield theatricals would enliven
      the whole neighbourhood exceedingly,&rdquo; Edmund still held his peace, and
      shewed his feelings only by a determined gravity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not very sanguine as to our play,&rdquo; said Miss Crawford, in an
      undervoice to Fanny, after some consideration; &ldquo;and I can tell Mr. Maddox
      that I shall shorten some of <i>his</i> speeches, and a great many of <i>my</i>
      <i>own</i>, before we rehearse together. It will be very disagreeable, and
      by no means what I expected.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVI
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was not in Miss Crawford&rsquo;s power to talk Fanny into any real
      forgetfulness of what had passed. When the evening was over, she went to
      bed full of it, her nerves still agitated by the shock of such an attack
      from her cousin Tom, so public and so persevered in, and her spirits
      sinking under her aunt&rsquo;s unkind reflection and reproach. To be called into
      notice in such a manner, to hear that it was but the prelude to something
      so infinitely worse, to be told that she must do what was so impossible as
      to act; and then to have the charge of obstinacy and ingratitude follow
      it, enforced with such a hint at the dependence of her situation, had been
      too distressing at the time to make the remembrance when she was alone
      much less so, especially with the superadded dread of what the morrow
      might produce in continuation of the subject. Miss Crawford had protected
      her only for the time; and if she were applied to again among themselves
      with all the authoritative urgency that Tom and Maria were capable of, and
      Edmund perhaps away, what should she do? She fell asleep before she could
      answer the question, and found it quite as puzzling when she awoke the
      next morning. The little white attic, which had continued her
      sleeping-room ever since her first entering the family, proving
      incompetent to suggest any reply, she had recourse, as soon as she was
      dressed, to another apartment more spacious and more meet for walking
      about in and thinking, and of which she had now for some time been almost
      equally mistress. It had been their school-room; so called till the Miss
      Bertrams would not allow it to be called so any longer, and inhabited as
      such to a later period. There Miss Lee had lived, and there they had read
      and written, and talked and laughed, till within the last three years,
      when she had quitted them. The room had then become useless, and for some
      time was quite deserted, except by Fanny, when she visited her plants, or
      wanted one of the books, which she was still glad to keep there, from the
      deficiency of space and accommodation in her little chamber above: but
      gradually, as her value for the comforts of it increased, she had added to
      her possessions, and spent more of her time there; and having nothing to
      oppose her, had so naturally and so artlessly worked herself into it, that
      it was now generally admitted to be hers. The East room, as it had been
      called ever since Maria Bertram was sixteen, was now considered Fanny&rsquo;s,
      almost as decidedly as the white attic: the smallness of the one making
      the use of the other so evidently reasonable that the Miss Bertrams, with
      every superiority in their own apartments which their own sense of
      superiority could demand, were entirely approving it; and Mrs. Norris,
      having stipulated for there never being a fire in it on Fanny&rsquo;s account,
      was tolerably resigned to her having the use of what nobody else wanted,
      though the terms in which she sometimes spoke of the indulgence seemed to
      imply that it was the best room in the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      The aspect was so favourable that even without a fire it was habitable in
      many an early spring and late autumn morning to such a willing mind as
      Fanny&rsquo;s; and while there was a gleam of sunshine she hoped not to be
      driven from it entirely, even when winter came. The comfort of it in her
      hours of leisure was extreme. She could go there after anything unpleasant
      below, and find immediate consolation in some pursuit, or some train of
      thought at hand. Her plants, her books&mdash;of which she had been a
      collector from the first hour of her commanding a shilling&mdash;her
      writing-desk, and her works of charity and ingenuity, were all within her
      reach; or if indisposed for employment, if nothing but musing would do,
      she could scarcely see an object in that room which had not an interesting
      remembrance connected with it. Everything was a friend, or bore her
      thoughts to a friend; and though there had been sometimes much of
      suffering to her; though her motives had often been misunderstood, her
      feelings disregarded, and her comprehension undervalued; though she had
      known the pains of tyranny, of ridicule, and neglect, yet almost every
      recurrence of either had led to something consolatory: her aunt Bertram
      had spoken for her, or Miss Lee had been encouraging, or, what was yet
      more frequent or more dear, Edmund had been her champion and her friend:
      he had supported her cause or explained her meaning, he had told her not
      to cry, or had given her some proof of affection which made her tears
      delightful; and the whole was now so blended together, so harmonised by
      distance, that every former affliction had its charm. The room was most
      dear to her, and she would not have changed its furniture for the
      handsomest in the house, though what had been originally plain had
      suffered all the ill-usage of children; and its greatest elegancies and
      ornaments were a faded footstool of Julia&rsquo;s work, too ill done for the
      drawing-room, three transparencies, made in a rage for transparencies, for
      the three lower panes of one window, where Tintern Abbey held its station
      between a cave in Italy and a moonlight lake in Cumberland, a collection
      of family profiles, thought unworthy of being anywhere else, over the
      mantelpiece, and by their side, and pinned against the wall, a small
      sketch of a ship sent four years ago from the Mediterranean by William,
      with H.M.S. Antwerp at the bottom, in letters as tall as the mainmast.
    </p>
    <p>
      To this nest of comforts Fanny now walked down to try its influence on an
      agitated, doubting spirit, to see if by looking at Edmund&rsquo;s profile she
      could catch any of his counsel, or by giving air to her geraniums she
      might inhale a breeze of mental strength herself. But she had more than
      fears of her own perseverance to remove: she had begun to feel undecided
      as to what she <i>ought</i> <i>to</i> <i>do</i>; and as she walked round
      the room her doubts were increasing. Was she <i>right</i> in refusing what
      was so warmly asked, so strongly wished for&mdash;what might be so
      essential to a scheme on which some of those to whom she owed the greatest
      complaisance had set their hearts? Was it not ill-nature, selfishness, and
      a fear of exposing herself? And would Edmund&rsquo;s judgment, would his
      persuasion of Sir Thomas&rsquo;s disapprobation of the whole, be enough to
      justify her in a determined denial in spite of all the rest? It would be
      so horrible to her to act that she was inclined to suspect the truth and
      purity of her own scruples; and as she looked around her, the claims of
      her cousins to being obliged were strengthened by the sight of present
      upon present that she had received from them. The table between the
      windows was covered with work-boxes and netting-boxes which had been given
      her at different times, principally by Tom; and she grew bewildered as to
      the amount of the debt which all these kind remembrances produced. A tap
      at the door roused her in the midst of this attempt to find her way to her
      duty, and her gentle &ldquo;Come in&rdquo; was answered by the appearance of one,
      before whom all her doubts were wont to be laid. Her eyes brightened at
      the sight of Edmund.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can I speak with you, Fanny, for a few minutes?&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, certainly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to consult. I want your opinion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My opinion!&rdquo; she cried, shrinking from such a compliment, highly as it
      gratified her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, your advice and opinion. I do not know what to do. This acting
      scheme gets worse and worse, you see. They have chosen almost as bad a
      play as they could, and now, to complete the business, are going to ask
      the help of a young man very slightly known to any of us. This is the end
      of all the privacy and propriety which was talked about at first. I know
      no harm of Charles Maddox; but the excessive intimacy which must spring
      from his being admitted among us in this manner is highly objectionable,
      the <i>more</i> than intimacy&mdash;the familiarity. I cannot think of it
      with any patience; and it does appear to me an evil of such magnitude as
      must, <i>if</i> <i>possible</i>, be prevented. Do not you see it in the
      same light?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; but what can be done? Your brother is so determined.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is but <i>one</i> thing to be done, Fanny. I must take Anhalt
      myself. I am well aware that nothing else will quiet Tom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fanny could not answer him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not at all what I like,&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;No man can like being
      driven into the <i>appearance</i> of such inconsistency. After being known
      to oppose the scheme from the beginning, there is absurdity in the face of
      my joining them <i>now</i>, when they are exceeding their first plan in
      every respect; but I can think of no other alternative. Can you, Fanny?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Fanny slowly, &ldquo;not immediately, but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what? I see your judgment is not with me. Think it a little over.
      Perhaps you are not so much aware as I am of the mischief that <i>may</i>,
      of the unpleasantness that <i>must</i> arise from a young man&rsquo;s being
      received in this manner: domesticated among us; authorised to come at all
      hours, and placed suddenly on a footing which must do away all restraints.
      To think only of the licence which every rehearsal must tend to create. It
      is all very bad! Put yourself in Miss Crawford&rsquo;s place, Fanny. Consider
      what it would be to act Amelia with a stranger. She has a right to be felt
      for, because she evidently feels for herself. I heard enough of what she
      said to you last night to understand her unwillingness to be acting with a
      stranger; and as she probably engaged in the part with different
      expectations&mdash;perhaps without considering the subject enough to know
      what was likely to be&mdash;it would be ungenerous, it would be really
      wrong to expose her to it. Her feelings ought to be respected. Does it not
      strike you so, Fanny? You hesitate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry for Miss Crawford; but I am more sorry to see you drawn in to
      do what you had resolved against, and what you are known to think will be
      disagreeable to my uncle. It will be such a triumph to the others!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They will not have much cause of triumph when they see how infamously I
      act. But, however, triumph there certainly will be, and I must brave it.
      But if I can be the means of restraining the publicity of the business, of
      limiting the exhibition, of concentrating our folly, I shall be well
      repaid. As I am now, I have no influence, I can do nothing: I have
      offended them, and they will not hear me; but when I have put them in
      good-humour by this concession, I am not without hopes of persuading them
      to confine the representation within a much smaller circle than they are
      now in the high road for. This will be a material gain. My object is to
      confine it to Mrs. Rushworth and the Grants. Will not this be worth
      gaining?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it will be a great point.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But still it has not your approbation. Can you mention any other measure
      by which I have a chance of doing equal good?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I cannot think of anything else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give me your approbation, then, Fanny. I am not comfortable without it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, cousin!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you are against me, I ought to distrust myself, and yet&mdash;But it
      is absolutely impossible to let Tom go on in this way, riding about the
      country in quest of anybody who can be persuaded to act&mdash;no matter
      whom: the look of a gentleman is to be enough. I thought <i>you</i> would
      have entered more into Miss Crawford&rsquo;s feelings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No doubt she will be very glad. It must be a great relief to her,&rdquo; said
      Fanny, trying for greater warmth of manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She never appeared more amiable than in her behaviour to you last night.
      It gave her a very strong claim on my goodwill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She <i>was</i> very kind, indeed, and I am glad to have her spared&rdquo;...
    </p>
    <p>
      She could not finish the generous effusion. Her conscience stopt her in
      the middle, but Edmund was satisfied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall walk down immediately after breakfast,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and am sure of
      giving pleasure there. And now, dear Fanny, I will not interrupt you any
      longer. You want to be reading. But I could not be easy till I had spoken
      to you, and come to a decision. Sleeping or waking, my head has been full
      of this matter all night. It is an evil, but I am certainly making it less
      than it might be. If Tom is up, I shall go to him directly and get it
      over, and when we meet at breakfast we shall be all in high good-humour at
      the prospect of acting the fool together with such unanimity. <i>You</i>,
      in the meanwhile, will be taking a trip into China, I suppose. How does
      Lord Macartney go on?&rdquo;&mdash;opening a volume on the table and then taking
      up some others. &ldquo;And here are Crabbe&rsquo;s Tales, and the Idler, at hand to
      relieve you, if you tire of your great book. I admire your little
      establishment exceedingly; and as soon as I am gone, you will empty your
      head of all this nonsense of acting, and sit comfortably down to your
      table. But do not stay here to be cold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He went; but there was no reading, no China, no composure for Fanny. He
      had told her the most extraordinary, the most inconceivable, the most
      unwelcome news; and she could think of nothing else. To be acting! After
      all his objections&mdash;objections so just and so public! After all that
      she had heard him say, and seen him look, and known him to be feeling.
      Could it be possible? Edmund so inconsistent! Was he not deceiving
      himself? Was he not wrong? Alas! it was all Miss Crawford&rsquo;s doing. She had
      seen her influence in every speech, and was miserable. The doubts and
      alarms as to her own conduct, which had previously distressed her, and
      which had all slept while she listened to him, were become of little
      consequence now. This deeper anxiety swallowed them up. Things should take
      their course; she cared not how it ended. Her cousins might attack, but
      could hardly tease her. She was beyond their reach; and if at last obliged
      to yield&mdash;no matter&mdash;it was all misery now.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVII
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was, indeed, a triumphant day to Mr. Bertram and Maria. Such a victory
      over Edmund&rsquo;s discretion had been beyond their hopes, and was most
      delightful. There was no longer anything to disturb them in their darling
      project, and they congratulated each other in private on the jealous
      weakness to which they attributed the change, with all the glee of
      feelings gratified in every way. Edmund might still look grave, and say he
      did not like the scheme in general, and must disapprove the play in
      particular; their point was gained: he was to act, and he was driven to it
      by the force of selfish inclinations only. Edmund had descended from that
      moral elevation which he had maintained before, and they were both as much
      the better as the happier for the descent.
    </p>
    <p>
      They behaved very well, however, to <i>him</i> on the occasion, betraying
      no exultation beyond the lines about the corners of the mouth, and seemed
      to think it as great an escape to be quit of the intrusion of Charles
      Maddox, as if they had been forced into admitting him against their
      inclination. &ldquo;To have it quite in their own family circle was what they
      had particularly wished. A stranger among them would have been the
      destruction of all their comfort&rdquo;; and when Edmund, pursuing that idea,
      gave a hint of his hope as to the limitation of the audience, they were
      ready, in the complaisance of the moment, to promise anything. It was all
      good-humour and encouragement. Mrs. Norris offered to contrive his dress,
      Mr. Yates assured him that Anhalt&rsquo;s last scene with the Baron admitted a
      good deal of action and emphasis, and Mr. Rushworth undertook to count his
      speeches.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; said Tom, &ldquo;Fanny may be more disposed to oblige us now. Perhaps
      you may persuade <i>her</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, she is quite determined. She certainly will not act.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! very well.&rdquo; And not another word was said; but Fanny felt herself
      again in danger, and her indifference to the danger was beginning to fail
      her already.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were not fewer smiles at the Parsonage than at the Park on this
      change in Edmund; Miss Crawford looked very lovely in hers, and entered
      with such an instantaneous renewal of cheerfulness into the whole affair
      as could have but one effect on him. &ldquo;He was certainly right in respecting
      such feelings; he was glad he had determined on it.&rdquo; And the morning wore
      away in satisfactions very sweet, if not very sound. One advantage
      resulted from it to Fanny: at the earnest request of Miss Crawford, Mrs.
      Grant had, with her usual good-humour, agreed to undertake the part for
      which Fanny had been wanted; and this was all that occurred to gladden <i>her</i>
      heart during the day; and even this, when imparted by Edmund, brought a
      pang with it, for it was Miss Crawford to whom she was obliged&mdash;it
      was Miss Crawford whose kind exertions were to excite her gratitude, and
      whose merit in making them was spoken of with a glow of admiration. She
      was safe; but peace and safety were unconnected here. Her mind had been
      never farther from peace. She could not feel that she had done wrong
      herself, but she was disquieted in every other way. Her heart and her
      judgment were equally against Edmund&rsquo;s decision: she could not acquit his
      unsteadiness, and his happiness under it made her wretched. She was full
      of jealousy and agitation. Miss Crawford came with looks of gaiety which
      seemed an insult, with friendly expressions towards herself which she
      could hardly answer calmly. Everybody around her was gay and busy,
      prosperous and important; each had their object of interest, their part,
      their dress, their favourite scene, their friends and confederates: all
      were finding employment in consultations and comparisons, or diversion in
      the playful conceits they suggested. She alone was sad and insignificant:
      she had no share in anything; she might go or stay; she might be in the
      midst of their noise, or retreat from it to the solitude of the East room,
      without being seen or missed. She could almost think anything would have
      been preferable to this. Mrs. Grant was of consequence: <i>her</i>
      good-nature had honourable mention; her taste and her time were
      considered; her presence was wanted; she was sought for, and attended, and
      praised; and Fanny was at first in some danger of envying her the
      character she had accepted. But reflection brought better feelings, and
      shewed her that Mrs. Grant was entitled to respect, which could never have
      belonged to <i>her</i>; and that, had she received even the greatest, she
      could never have been easy in joining a scheme which, considering only her
      uncle, she must condemn altogether.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fanny&rsquo;s heart was not absolutely the only saddened one amongst them, as
      she soon began to acknowledge to herself. Julia was a sufferer too, though
      not quite so blamelessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry Crawford had trifled with her feelings; but she had very long
      allowed and even sought his attentions, with a jealousy of her sister so
      reasonable as ought to have been their cure; and now that the conviction
      of his preference for Maria had been forced on her, she submitted to it
      without any alarm for Maria&rsquo;s situation, or any endeavour at rational
      tranquillity for herself. She either sat in gloomy silence, wrapt in such
      gravity as nothing could subdue, no curiosity touch, no wit amuse; or
      allowing the attentions of Mr. Yates, was talking with forced gaiety to
      him alone, and ridiculing the acting of the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a day or two after the affront was given, Henry Crawford had
      endeavoured to do it away by the usual attack of gallantry and compliment,
      but he had not cared enough about it to persevere against a few repulses;
      and becoming soon too busy with his play to have time for more than one
      flirtation, he grew indifferent to the quarrel, or rather thought it a
      lucky occurrence, as quietly putting an end to what might ere long have
      raised expectations in more than Mrs. Grant. She was not pleased to see
      Julia excluded from the play, and sitting by disregarded; but as it was
      not a matter which really involved her happiness, as Henry must be the
      best judge of his own, and as he did assure her, with a most persuasive
      smile, that neither he nor Julia had ever had a serious thought of each
      other, she could only renew her former caution as to the elder sister,
      entreat him not to risk his tranquillity by too much admiration there, and
      then gladly take her share in anything that brought cheerfulness to the
      young people in general, and that did so particularly promote the pleasure
      of the two so dear to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I rather wonder Julia is not in love with Henry,&rdquo; was her observation to
      Mary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare say she is,&rdquo; replied Mary coldly. &ldquo;I imagine both sisters are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Both! no, no, that must not be. Do not give him a hint of it. Think of
      Mr. Rushworth!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had better tell Miss Bertram to think of Mr. Rushworth. It may do <i>her</i>
      some good. I often think of Mr. Rushworth&rsquo;s property and independence, and
      wish them in other hands; but I never think of him. A man might represent
      the county with such an estate; a man might escape a profession and
      represent the county.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare say he <i>will</i> be in parliament soon. When Sir Thomas comes, I
      dare say he will be in for some borough, but there has been nobody to put
      him in the way of doing anything yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir Thomas is to achieve many mighty things when he comes home,&rdquo; said
      Mary, after a pause. &ldquo;Do you remember Hawkins Browne&rsquo;s &lsquo;Address to
      Tobacco,&rsquo; in imitation of Pope?&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Blest leaf! whose aromatic gales dispense
     To Templars modesty, to Parsons sense.
</pre>
    <p>
      I will parody them&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Blest Knight! whose dictatorial looks dispense
     To Children affluence, to Rushworth sense.
</pre>
    <p>
      Will not that do, Mrs. Grant? Everything seems to depend upon Sir Thomas&rsquo;s
      return.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will find his consequence very just and reasonable when you see him
      in his family, I assure you. I do not think we do so well without him. He
      has a fine dignified manner, which suits the head of such a house, and
      keeps everybody in their place. Lady Bertram seems more of a cipher now
      than when he is at home; and nobody else can keep Mrs. Norris in order.
      But, Mary, do not fancy that Maria Bertram cares for Henry. I am sure <i>Julia</i>
      does not, or she would not have flirted as she did last night with Mr.
      Yates; and though he and Maria are very good friends, I think she likes
      Sotherton too well to be inconstant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would not give much for Mr. Rushworth&rsquo;s chance if Henry stept in before
      the articles were signed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you have such a suspicion, something must be done; and as soon as the
      play is all over, we will talk to him seriously and make him know his own
      mind; and if he means nothing, we will send him off, though he is Henry,
      for a time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Julia <i>did</i> suffer, however, though Mrs. Grant discerned it not, and
      though it escaped the notice of many of her own family likewise. She had
      loved, she did love still, and she had all the suffering which a warm
      temper and a high spirit were likely to endure under the disappointment of
      a dear, though irrational hope, with a strong sense of ill-usage. Her
      heart was sore and angry, and she was capable only of angry consolations.
      The sister with whom she was used to be on easy terms was now become her
      greatest enemy: they were alienated from each other; and Julia was not
      superior to the hope of some distressing end to the attentions which were
      still carrying on there, some punishment to Maria for conduct so shameful
      towards herself as well as towards Mr. Rushworth. With no material fault
      of temper, or difference of opinion, to prevent their being very good
      friends while their interests were the same, the sisters, under such a
      trial as this, had not affection or principle enough to make them merciful
      or just, to give them honour or compassion. Maria felt her triumph, and
      pursued her purpose, careless of Julia; and Julia could never see Maria
      distinguished by Henry Crawford without trusting that it would create
      jealousy, and bring a public disturbance at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fanny saw and pitied much of this in Julia; but there was no outward
      fellowship between them. Julia made no communication, and Fanny took no
      liberties. They were two solitary sufferers, or connected only by Fanny&rsquo;s
      consciousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The inattention of the two brothers and the aunt to Julia&rsquo;s discomposure,
      and their blindness to its true cause, must be imputed to the fullness of
      their own minds. They were totally preoccupied. Tom was engrossed by the
      concerns of his theatre, and saw nothing that did not immediately relate
      to it. Edmund, between his theatrical and his real part, between Miss
      Crawford&rsquo;s claims and his own conduct, between love and consistency, was
      equally unobservant; and Mrs. Norris was too busy in contriving and
      directing the general little matters of the company, superintending their
      various dresses with economical expedient, for which nobody thanked her,
      and saving, with delighted integrity, half a crown here and there to the
      absent Sir Thomas, to have leisure for watching the behaviour, or guarding
      the happiness of his daughters.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Everything was now in a regular train: theatre, actors, actresses, and
      dresses, were all getting forward; but though no other great impediments
      arose, Fanny found, before many days were past, that it was not all
      uninterrupted enjoyment to the party themselves, and that she had not to
      witness the continuance of such unanimity and delight as had been almost
      too much for her at first. Everybody began to have their vexation. Edmund
      had many. Entirely against <i>his</i> judgment, a scene-painter arrived
      from town, and was at work, much to the increase of the expenses, and,
      what was worse, of the eclat of their proceedings; and his brother,
      instead of being really guided by him as to the privacy of the
      representation, was giving an invitation to every family who came in his
      way. Tom himself began to fret over the scene-painter&rsquo;s slow progress, and
      to feel the miseries of waiting. He had learned his part&mdash;all his
      parts, for he took every trifling one that could be united with the
      Butler, and began to be impatient to be acting; and every day thus
      unemployed was tending to increase his sense of the insignificance of all
      his parts together, and make him more ready to regret that some other play
      had not been chosen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fanny, being always a very courteous listener, and often the only listener
      at hand, came in for the complaints and the distresses of most of them. <i>She</i>
      knew that Mr. Yates was in general thought to rant dreadfully; that Mr.
      Yates was disappointed in Henry Crawford; that Tom Bertram spoke so quick
      he would be unintelligible; that Mrs. Grant spoiled everything by
      laughing; that Edmund was behindhand with his part, and that it was misery
      to have anything to do with Mr. Rushworth, who was wanting a prompter
      through every speech. She knew, also, that poor Mr. Rushworth could seldom
      get anybody to rehearse with him: <i>his</i> complaint came before her as
      well as the rest; and so decided to her eye was her cousin Maria&rsquo;s
      avoidance of him, and so needlessly often the rehearsal of the first scene
      between her and Mr. Crawford, that she had soon all the terror of other
      complaints from <i>him</i>. So far from being all satisfied and all
      enjoying, she found everybody requiring something they had not, and giving
      occasion of discontent to the others. Everybody had a part either too long
      or too short; nobody would attend as they ought; nobody would remember on
      which side they were to come in; nobody but the complainer would observe
      any directions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fanny believed herself to derive as much innocent enjoyment from the play
      as any of them; Henry Crawford acted well, and it was a pleasure to <i>her</i>
      to creep into the theatre, and attend the rehearsal of the first act, in
      spite of the feelings it excited in some speeches for Maria. Maria, she
      also thought, acted well, too well; and after the first rehearsal or two,
      Fanny began to be their only audience; and sometimes as prompter,
      sometimes as spectator, was often very useful. As far as she could judge,
      Mr. Crawford was considerably the best actor of all: he had more
      confidence than Edmund, more judgment than Tom, more talent and taste than
      Mr. Yates. She did not like him as a man, but she must admit him to be the
      best actor, and on this point there were not many who differed from her.
      Mr. Yates, indeed, exclaimed against his tameness and insipidity; and the
      day came at last, when Mr. Rushworth turned to her with a black look, and
      said, &ldquo;Do you think there is anything so very fine in all this? For the
      life and soul of me, I cannot admire him; and, between ourselves, to see
      such an undersized, little, mean-looking man, set up for a fine actor, is
      very ridiculous in my opinion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      From this moment there was a return of his former jealousy, which Maria,
      from increasing hopes of Crawford, was at little pains to remove; and the
      chances of Mr. Rushworth&rsquo;s ever attaining to the knowledge of his
      two-and-forty speeches became much less. As to his ever making anything <i>tolerable</i>
      of them, nobody had the smallest idea of that except his mother; <i>she</i>,
      indeed, regretted that his part was not more considerable, and deferred
      coming over to Mansfield till they were forward enough in their rehearsal
      to comprehend all his scenes; but the others aspired at nothing beyond his
      remembering the catchword, and the first line of his speech, and being
      able to follow the prompter through the rest. Fanny, in her pity and
      kindheartedness, was at great pains to teach him how to learn, giving him
      all the helps and directions in her power, trying to make an artificial
      memory for him, and learning every word of his part herself, but without
      his being much the forwarder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many uncomfortable, anxious, apprehensive feelings she certainly had; but
      with all these, and other claims on her time and attention, she was as far
      from finding herself without employment or utility amongst them, as
      without a companion in uneasiness; quite as far from having no demand on
      her leisure as on her compassion. The gloom of her first anticipations was
      proved to have been unfounded. She was occasionally useful to all; she was
      perhaps as much at peace as any.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a great deal of needlework to be done, moreover, in which her
      help was wanted; and that Mrs. Norris thought her quite as well off as the
      rest, was evident by the manner in which she claimed it&mdash;&ldquo;Come,
      Fanny,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;these are fine times for you, but you must not be
      always walking from one room to the other, and doing the lookings-on at
      your ease, in this way; I want you here. I have been slaving myself till I
      can hardly stand, to contrive Mr. Rushworth&rsquo;s cloak without sending for
      any more satin; and now I think you may give me your help in putting it
      together. There are but three seams; you may do them in a trice. It would
      be lucky for me if I had nothing but the executive part to do. <i>You</i>
      are best off, I can tell you: but if nobody did more than <i>you</i>, we
      should not get on very fast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fanny took the work very quietly, without attempting any defence; but her
      kinder aunt Bertram observed on her behalf&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One cannot wonder, sister, that Fanny <i>should</i> be delighted: it is
      all new to her, you know; you and I used to be very fond of a play
      ourselves, and so am I still; and as soon as I am a little more at
      leisure, <i>I</i> mean to look in at their rehearsals too. What is the
      play about, Fanny? you have never told me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! sister, pray do not ask her now; for Fanny is not one of those who
      can talk and work at the same time. It is about Lovers&rsquo; Vows.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe,&rdquo; said Fanny to her aunt Bertram, &ldquo;there will be three acts
      rehearsed to-morrow evening, and that will give you an opportunity of
      seeing all the actors at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had better stay till the curtain is hung,&rdquo; interposed Mrs. Norris;
      &ldquo;the curtain will be hung in a day or two&mdash;there is very little sense
      in a play without a curtain&mdash;and I am much mistaken if you do not
      find it draw up into very handsome festoons.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Bertram seemed quite resigned to waiting. Fanny did not share her
      aunt&rsquo;s composure: she thought of the morrow a great deal, for if the three
      acts were rehearsed, Edmund and Miss Crawford would then be acting
      together for the first time; the third act would bring a scene between
      them which interested her most particularly, and which she was longing and
      dreading to see how they would perform. The whole subject of it was love&mdash;a
      marriage of love was to be described by the gentleman, and very little
      short of a declaration of love be made by the lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had read and read the scene again with many painful, many wondering
      emotions, and looked forward to their representation of it as a
      circumstance almost too interesting. She did not <i>believe</i> they had
      yet rehearsed it, even in private.
    </p>
    <p>
      The morrow came, the plan for the evening continued, and Fanny&rsquo;s
      consideration of it did not become less agitated. She worked very
      diligently under her aunt&rsquo;s directions, but her diligence and her silence
      concealed a very absent, anxious mind; and about noon she made her escape
      with her work to the East room, that she might have no concern in another,
      and, as she deemed it, most unnecessary rehearsal of the first act, which
      Henry Crawford was just proposing, desirous at once of having her time to
      herself, and of avoiding the sight of Mr. Rushworth. A glimpse, as she
      passed through the hall, of the two ladies walking up from the Parsonage
      made no change in her wish of retreat, and she worked and meditated in the
      East room, undisturbed, for a quarter of an hour, when a gentle tap at the
      door was followed by the entrance of Miss Crawford.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I right? Yes; this is the East room. My dear Miss Price, I beg your
      pardon, but I have made my way to you on purpose to entreat your help.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fanny, quite surprised, endeavoured to shew herself mistress of the room
      by her civilities, and looked at the bright bars of her empty grate with
      concern.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you; I am quite warm, very warm. Allow me to stay here a little
      while, and do have the goodness to hear me my third act. I have brought my
      book, and if you would but rehearse it with me, I should be <i>so</i>
      obliged! I came here to-day intending to rehearse it with Edmund&mdash;by
      ourselves&mdash;against the evening, but he is not in the way; and if he
      <i>were</i>, I do not think I could go through it with <i>him</i>, till I
      have hardened myself a little; for really there is a speech or two. You
      will be so good, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fanny was most civil in her assurances, though she could not give them in
      a very steady voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you ever happened to look at the part I mean?&rdquo; continued Miss
      Crawford, opening her book. &ldquo;Here it is. I did not think much of it at
      first&mdash;but, upon my word. There, look at <i>that</i> speech, and <i>that</i>,
      and <i>that</i>. How am I ever to look him in the face and say such
      things? Could you do it? But then he is your cousin, which makes all the
      difference. You must rehearse it with me, that I may fancy <i>you</i> him,
      and get on by degrees. You <i>have</i> a look of <i>his</i> sometimes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have I? I will do my best with the greatest readiness; but I must <i>read</i>
      the part, for I can say very little of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>None</i> of it, I suppose. You are to have the book, of course. Now
      for it. We must have two chairs at hand for you to bring forward to the
      front of the stage. There&mdash;very good school-room chairs, not made for
      a theatre, I dare say; much more fitted for little girls to sit and kick
      their feet against when they are learning a lesson. What would your
      governess and your uncle say to see them used for such a purpose? Could
      Sir Thomas look in upon us just now, he would bless himself, for we are
      rehearsing all over the house. Yates is storming away in the dining-room.
      I heard him as I came upstairs, and the theatre is engaged of course by
      those indefatigable rehearsers, Agatha and Frederick. If <i>they</i> are
      not perfect, I <i>shall</i> be surprised. By the bye, I looked in upon
      them five minutes ago, and it happened to be exactly at one of the times
      when they were trying <i>not</i> to embrace, and Mr. Rushworth was with
      me. I thought he began to look a little queer, so I turned it off as well
      as I could, by whispering to him, &lsquo;We shall have an excellent Agatha;
      there is something so <i>maternal</i> in her manner, so completely <i>maternal</i>
      in her voice and countenance.&rsquo; Was not that well done of me? He brightened
      up directly. Now for my soliloquy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She began, and Fanny joined in with all the modest feeling which the idea
      of representing Edmund was so strongly calculated to inspire; but with
      looks and voice so truly feminine as to be no very good picture of a man.
      With such an Anhalt, however, Miss Crawford had courage enough; and they
      had got through half the scene, when a tap at the door brought a pause,
      and the entrance of Edmund, the next moment, suspended it all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Surprise, consciousness, and pleasure appeared in each of the three on
      this unexpected meeting; and as Edmund was come on the very same business
      that had brought Miss Crawford, consciousness and pleasure were likely to
      be more than momentary in <i>them</i>. He too had his book, and was
      seeking Fanny, to ask her to rehearse with him, and help him to prepare
      for the evening, without knowing Miss Crawford to be in the house; and
      great was the joy and animation of being thus thrown together, of
      comparing schemes, and sympathising in praise of Fanny&rsquo;s kind offices.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>She</i> could not equal them in their warmth. <i>Her</i> spirits sank
      under the glow of theirs, and she felt herself becoming too nearly nothing
      to both to have any comfort in having been sought by either. They must now
      rehearse together. Edmund proposed, urged, entreated it, till the lady,
      not very unwilling at first, could refuse no longer, and Fanny was wanted
      only to prompt and observe them. She was invested, indeed, with the office
      of judge and critic, and earnestly desired to exercise it and tell them
      all their faults; but from doing so every feeling within her shrank&mdash;she
      could not, would not, dared not attempt it: had she been otherwise
      qualified for criticism, her conscience must have restrained her from
      venturing at disapprobation. She believed herself to feel too much of it
      in the aggregate for honesty or safety in particulars. To prompt them must
      be enough for her; and it was sometimes <i>more</i> than enough; for she
      could not always pay attention to the book. In watching them she forgot
      herself; and, agitated by the increasing spirit of Edmund&rsquo;s manner, had
      once closed the page and turned away exactly as he wanted help. It was
      imputed to very reasonable weariness, and she was thanked and pitied; but
      she deserved their pity more than she hoped they would ever surmise. At
      last the scene was over, and Fanny forced herself to add her praise to the
      compliments each was giving the other; and when again alone and able to
      recall the whole, she was inclined to believe their performance would,
      indeed, have such nature and feeling in it as must ensure their credit,
      and make it a very suffering exhibition to herself. Whatever might be its
      effect, however, she must stand the brunt of it again that very day.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first regular rehearsal of the three first acts was certainly to take
      place in the evening: Mrs. Grant and the Crawfords were engaged to return
      for that purpose as soon as they could after dinner; and every one
      concerned was looking forward with eagerness. There seemed a general
      diffusion of cheerfulness on the occasion. Tom was enjoying such an
      advance towards the end; Edmund was in spirits from the morning&rsquo;s
      rehearsal, and little vexations seemed everywhere smoothed away. All were
      alert and impatient; the ladies moved soon, the gentlemen soon followed
      them, and with the exception of Lady Bertram, Mrs. Norris, and Julia,
      everybody was in the theatre at an early hour; and having lighted it up as
      well as its unfinished state admitted, were waiting only the arrival of
      Mrs. Grant and the Crawfords to begin.
    </p>
    <p>
      They did not wait long for the Crawfords, but there was no Mrs. Grant. She
      could not come. Dr. Grant, professing an indisposition, for which he had
      little credit with his fair sister-in-law, could not spare his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dr. Grant is ill,&rdquo; said she, with mock solemnity. &ldquo;He has been ill ever
      since he did not eat any of the pheasant today. He fancied it tough, sent
      away his plate, and has been suffering ever since&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here was disappointment! Mrs. Grant&rsquo;s non-attendance was sad indeed. Her
      pleasant manners and cheerful conformity made her always valuable amongst
      them; but <i>now</i> she was absolutely necessary. They could not act,
      they could not rehearse with any satisfaction without her. The comfort of
      the whole evening was destroyed. What was to be done? Tom, as Cottager,
      was in despair. After a pause of perplexity, some eyes began to be turned
      towards Fanny, and a voice or two to say, &ldquo;If Miss Price would be so good
      as to <i>read</i> the part.&rdquo; She was immediately surrounded by
      supplications; everybody asked it; even Edmund said, &ldquo;Do, Fanny, if it is
      not <i>very</i> disagreeable to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Fanny still hung back. She could not endure the idea of it. Why was
      not Miss Crawford to be applied to as well? Or why had not she rather gone
      to her own room, as she had felt to be safest, instead of attending the
      rehearsal at all? She had known it would irritate and distress her; she
      had known it her duty to keep away. She was properly punished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have only to <i>read</i> the part,&rdquo; said Henry Crawford, with renewed
      entreaty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I do believe she can say every word of it,&rdquo; added Maria, &ldquo;for she
      could put Mrs. Grant right the other day in twenty places. Fanny, I am
      sure you know the part.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fanny could not say she did <i>not</i>; and as they all persevered, as
      Edmund repeated his wish, and with a look of even fond dependence on her
      good-nature, she must yield. She would do her best. Everybody was
      satisfied; and she was left to the tremors of a most palpitating heart,
      while the others prepared to begin.
    </p>
    <p>
      They <i>did</i> begin; and being too much engaged in their own noise to be
      struck by an unusual noise in the other part of the house, had proceeded
      some way when the door of the room was thrown open, and Julia, appearing
      at it, with a face all aghast, exclaimed, &ldquo;My father is come! He is in the
      hall at this moment.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIX
    </h2>
    <p>
      How is the consternation of the party to be described? To the greater
      number it was a moment of absolute horror. Sir Thomas in the house! All
      felt the instantaneous conviction. Not a hope of imposition or mistake was
      harboured anywhere. Julia&rsquo;s looks were an evidence of the fact that made
      it indisputable; and after the first starts and exclamations, not a word
      was spoken for half a minute: each with an altered countenance was looking
      at some other, and almost each was feeling it a stroke the most unwelcome,
      most ill-timed, most appalling! Mr. Yates might consider it only as a
      vexatious interruption for the evening, and Mr. Rushworth might imagine it
      a blessing; but every other heart was sinking under some degree of
      self-condemnation or undefined alarm, every other heart was suggesting,
      &ldquo;What will become of us? what is to be done now?&rdquo; It was a terrible pause;
      and terrible to every ear were the corroborating sounds of opening doors
      and passing footsteps.
    </p>
    <p>
      Julia was the first to move and speak again. Jealousy and bitterness had
      been suspended: selfishness was lost in the common cause; but at the
      moment of her appearance, Frederick was listening with looks of devotion
      to Agatha&rsquo;s narrative, and pressing her hand to his heart; and as soon as
      she could notice this, and see that, in spite of the shock of her words,
      he still kept his station and retained her sister&rsquo;s hand, her wounded
      heart swelled again with injury, and looking as red as she had been white
      before, she turned out of the room, saying, &ldquo;<i>I</i> need not be afraid
      of appearing before him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her going roused the rest; and at the same moment the two brothers stepped
      forward, feeling the necessity of doing something. A very few words
      between them were sufficient. The case admitted no difference of opinion:
      they must go to the drawing-room directly. Maria joined them with the same
      intent, just then the stoutest of the three; for the very circumstance
      which had driven Julia away was to her the sweetest support. Henry
      Crawford&rsquo;s retaining her hand at such a moment, a moment of such peculiar
      proof and importance, was worth ages of doubt and anxiety. She hailed it
      as an earnest of the most serious determination, and was equal even to
      encounter her father. They walked off, utterly heedless of Mr. Rushworth&rsquo;s
      repeated question of, &ldquo;Shall I go too? Had not I better go too? Will not
      it be right for me to go too?&rdquo; but they were no sooner through the door
      than Henry Crawford undertook to answer the anxious inquiry, and,
      encouraging him by all means to pay his respects to Sir Thomas without
      delay, sent him after the others with delighted haste.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fanny was left with only the Crawfords and Mr. Yates. She had been quite
      overlooked by her cousins; and as her own opinion of her claims on Sir
      Thomas&rsquo;s affection was much too humble to give her any idea of classing
      herself with his children, she was glad to remain behind and gain a little
      breathing-time. Her agitation and alarm exceeded all that was endured by
      the rest, by the right of a disposition which not even innocence could
      keep from suffering. She was nearly fainting: all her former habitual
      dread of her uncle was returning, and with it compassion for him and for
      almost every one of the party on the development before him, with
      solicitude on Edmund&rsquo;s account indescribable. She had found a seat, where
      in excessive trembling she was enduring all these fearful thoughts, while
      the other three, no longer under any restraint, were giving vent to their
      feelings of vexation, lamenting over such an unlooked-for premature
      arrival as a most untoward event, and without mercy wishing poor Sir
      Thomas had been twice as long on his passage, or were still in Antigua.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Crawfords were more warm on the subject than Mr. Yates, from better
      understanding the family, and judging more clearly of the mischief that
      must ensue. The ruin of the play was to them a certainty: they felt the
      total destruction of the scheme to be inevitably at hand; while Mr. Yates
      considered it only as a temporary interruption, a disaster for the
      evening, and could even suggest the possibility of the rehearsal being
      renewed after tea, when the bustle of receiving Sir Thomas were over, and
      he might be at leisure to be amused by it. The Crawfords laughed at the
      idea; and having soon agreed on the propriety of their walking quietly
      home and leaving the family to themselves, proposed Mr. Yates&rsquo;s
      accompanying them and spending the evening at the Parsonage. But Mr.
      Yates, having never been with those who thought much of parental claims,
      or family confidence, could not perceive that anything of the kind was
      necessary; and therefore, thanking them, said, &ldquo;he preferred remaining
      where he was, that he might pay his respects to the old gentleman
      handsomely since he <i>was</i> come; and besides, he did not think it
      would be fair by the others to have everybody run away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fanny was just beginning to collect herself, and to feel that if she staid
      longer behind it might seem disrespectful, when this point was settled,
      and being commissioned with the brother and sister&rsquo;s apology, saw them
      preparing to go as she quitted the room herself to perform the dreadful
      duty of appearing before her uncle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Too soon did she find herself at the drawing-room door; and after pausing
      a moment for what she knew would not come, for a courage which the outside
      of no door had ever supplied to her, she turned the lock in desperation,
      and the lights of the drawing-room, and all the collected family, were
      before her. As she entered, her own name caught her ear. Sir Thomas was at
      that moment looking round him, and saying, &ldquo;But where is Fanny? Why do not
      I see my little Fanny?&rdquo;&mdash;and on perceiving her, came forward with a
      kindness which astonished and penetrated her, calling her his dear Fanny,
      kissing her affectionately, and observing with decided pleasure how much
      she was grown! Fanny knew not how to feel, nor where to look. She was
      quite oppressed. He had never been so kind, so <i>very</i> kind to her in
      his life. His manner seemed changed, his voice was quick from the
      agitation of joy; and all that had been awful in his dignity seemed lost
      in tenderness. He led her nearer the light and looked at her again&mdash;inquired
      particularly after her health, and then, correcting himself, observed that
      he need not inquire, for her appearance spoke sufficiently on that point.
      A fine blush having succeeded the previous paleness of her face, he was
      justified in his belief of her equal improvement in health and beauty. He
      inquired next after her family, especially William: and his kindness
      altogether was such as made her reproach herself for loving him so little,
      and thinking his return a misfortune; and when, on having courage to lift
      her eyes to his face, she saw that he was grown thinner, and had the
      burnt, fagged, worn look of fatigue and a hot climate, every tender
      feeling was increased, and she was miserable in considering how much
      unsuspected vexation was probably ready to burst on him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Thomas was indeed the life of the party, who at his suggestion now
      seated themselves round the fire. He had the best right to be the talker;
      and the delight of his sensations in being again in his own house, in the
      centre of his family, after such a separation, made him communicative and
      chatty in a very unusual degree; and he was ready to give every
      information as to his voyage, and answer every question of his two sons
      almost before it was put. His business in Antigua had latterly been
      prosperously rapid, and he came directly from Liverpool, having had an
      opportunity of making his passage thither in a private vessel, instead of
      waiting for the packet; and all the little particulars of his proceedings
      and events, his arrivals and departures, were most promptly delivered, as
      he sat by Lady Bertram and looked with heartfelt satisfaction on the faces
      around him&mdash;interrupting himself more than once, however, to remark
      on his good fortune in finding them all at home&mdash;coming unexpectedly
      as he did&mdash;all collected together exactly as he could have wished,
      but dared not depend on. Mr. Rushworth was not forgotten: a most friendly
      reception and warmth of hand-shaking had already met him, and with pointed
      attention he was now included in the objects most intimately connected
      with Mansfield. There was nothing disagreeable in Mr. Rushworth&rsquo;s
      appearance, and Sir Thomas was liking him already.
    </p>
    <p>
      By not one of the circle was he listened to with such unbroken, unalloyed
      enjoyment as by his wife, who was really extremely happy to see him, and
      whose feelings were so warmed by his sudden arrival as to place her nearer
      agitation than she had been for the last twenty years. She had been <i>almost</i>
      fluttered for a few minutes, and still remained so sensibly animated as to
      put away her work, move Pug from her side, and give all her attention and
      all the rest of her sofa to her husband. She had no anxieties for anybody
      to cloud <i>her</i> pleasure: her own time had been irreproachably spent
      during his absence: she had done a great deal of carpet-work, and made
      many yards of fringe; and she would have answered as freely for the good
      conduct and useful pursuits of all the young people as for her own. It was
      so agreeable to her to see him again, and hear him talk, to have her ear
      amused and her whole comprehension filled by his narratives, that she
      began particularly to feel how dreadfully she must have missed him, and
      how impossible it would have been for her to bear a lengthened absence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Norris was by no means to be compared in happiness to her sister. Not
      that <i>she</i> was incommoded by many fears of Sir Thomas&rsquo;s
      disapprobation when the present state of his house should be known, for
      her judgment had been so blinded that, except by the instinctive caution
      with which she had whisked away Mr. Rushworth&rsquo;s pink satin cloak as her
      brother-in-law entered, she could hardly be said to shew any sign of
      alarm; but she was vexed by the <i>manner</i> of his return. It had left
      her nothing to do. Instead of being sent for out of the room, and seeing
      him first, and having to spread the happy news through the house, Sir
      Thomas, with a very reasonable dependence, perhaps, on the nerves of his
      wife and children, had sought no confidant but the butler, and had been
      following him almost instantaneously into the drawing-room. Mrs. Norris
      felt herself defrauded of an office on which she had always depended,
      whether his arrival or his death were to be the thing unfolded; and was
      now trying to be in a bustle without having anything to bustle about, and
      labouring to be important where nothing was wanted but tranquillity and
      silence. Would Sir Thomas have consented to eat, she might have gone to
      the housekeeper with troublesome directions, and insulted the footmen with
      injunctions of despatch; but Sir Thomas resolutely declined all dinner: he
      would take nothing, nothing till tea came&mdash;he would rather wait for
      tea. Still Mrs. Norris was at intervals urging something different; and in
      the most interesting moment of his passage to England, when the alarm of a
      French privateer was at the height, she burst through his recital with the
      proposal of soup. &ldquo;Sure, my dear Sir Thomas, a basin of soup would be a
      much better thing for you than tea. Do have a basin of soup.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sir Thomas could not be provoked. &ldquo;Still the same anxiety for everybody&rsquo;s
      comfort, my dear Mrs. Norris,&rdquo; was his answer. &ldquo;But indeed I would rather
      have nothing but tea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, Lady Bertram, suppose you speak for tea directly; suppose you
      hurry Baddeley a little; he seems behindhand to-night.&rdquo; She carried this
      point, and Sir Thomas&rsquo;s narrative proceeded.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length there was a pause. His immediate communications were exhausted,
      and it seemed enough to be looking joyfully around him, now at one, now at
      another of the beloved circle; but the pause was not long: in the elation
      of her spirits Lady Bertram became talkative, and what were the sensations
      of her children upon hearing her say, &ldquo;How do you think the young people
      have been amusing themselves lately, Sir Thomas? They have been acting. We
      have been all alive with acting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed! and what have you been acting?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! they&rsquo;ll tell you all about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The <i>all</i> will soon be told,&rdquo; cried Tom hastily, and with affected
      unconcern; &ldquo;but it is not worth while to bore my father with it now. You
      will hear enough of it to-morrow, sir. We have just been trying, by way of
      doing something, and amusing my mother, just within the last week, to get
      up a few scenes, a mere trifle. We have had such incessant rains almost
      since October began, that we have been nearly confined to the house for
      days together. I have hardly taken out a gun since the 3rd. Tolerable
      sport the first three days, but there has been no attempting anything
      since. The first day I went over Mansfield Wood, and Edmund took the
      copses beyond Easton, and we brought home six brace between us, and might
      each have killed six times as many, but we respect your pheasants, sir, I
      assure you, as much as you could desire. I do not think you will find your
      woods by any means worse stocked than they were. <i>I</i> never saw
      Mansfield Wood so full of pheasants in my life as this year. I hope you
      will take a day&rsquo;s sport there yourself, sir, soon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For the present the danger was over, and Fanny&rsquo;s sick feelings subsided;
      but when tea was soon afterwards brought in, and Sir Thomas, getting up,
      said that he found that he could not be any longer in the house without
      just looking into his own dear room, every agitation was returning. He was
      gone before anything had been said to prepare him for the change he must
      find there; and a pause of alarm followed his disappearance. Edmund was
      the first to speak&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something must be done,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is time to think of our visitors,&rdquo; said Maria, still feeling her hand
      pressed to Henry Crawford&rsquo;s heart, and caring little for anything else.
      &ldquo;Where did you leave Miss Crawford, Fanny?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fanny told of their departure, and delivered their message.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then poor Yates is all alone,&rdquo; cried Tom. &ldquo;I will go and fetch him. He
      will be no bad assistant when it all comes out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To the theatre he went, and reached it just in time to witness the first
      meeting of his father and his friend. Sir Thomas had been a good deal
      surprised to find candles burning in his room; and on casting his eye
      round it, to see other symptoms of recent habitation and a general air of
      confusion in the furniture. The removal of the bookcase from before the
      billiard-room door struck him especially, but he had scarcely more than
      time to feel astonished at all this, before there were sounds from the
      billiard-room to astonish him still farther. Some one was talking there in
      a very loud accent; he did not know the voice&mdash;more than talking&mdash;almost
      hallooing. He stepped to the door, rejoicing at that moment in having the
      means of immediate communication, and, opening it, found himself on the
      stage of a theatre, and opposed to a ranting young man, who appeared
      likely to knock him down backwards. At the very moment of Yates perceiving
      Sir Thomas, and giving perhaps the very best start he had ever given in
      the whole course of his rehearsals, Tom Bertram entered at the other end
      of the room; and never had he found greater difficulty in keeping his
      countenance. His father&rsquo;s looks of solemnity and amazement on this his
      first appearance on any stage, and the gradual metamorphosis of the
      impassioned Baron Wildenheim into the well-bred and easy Mr. Yates, making
      his bow and apology to Sir Thomas Bertram, was such an exhibition, such a
      piece of true acting, as he would not have lost upon any account. It would
      be the last&mdash;in all probability&mdash;the last scene on that stage;
      but he was sure there could not be a finer. The house would close with the
      greatest eclat.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was little time, however, for the indulgence of any images of
      merriment. It was necessary for him to step forward, too, and assist the
      introduction, and with many awkward sensations he did his best. Sir Thomas
      received Mr. Yates with all the appearance of cordiality which was due to
      his own character, but was really as far from pleased with the necessity
      of the acquaintance as with the manner of its commencement. Mr. Yates&rsquo;s
      family and connexions were sufficiently known to him to render his
      introduction as the &ldquo;particular friend,&rdquo; another of the hundred particular
      friends of his son, exceedingly unwelcome; and it needed all the felicity
      of being again at home, and all the forbearance it could supply, to save
      Sir Thomas from anger on finding himself thus bewildered in his own house,
      making part of a ridiculous exhibition in the midst of theatrical
      nonsense, and forced in so untoward a moment to admit the acquaintance of
      a young man whom he felt sure of disapproving, and whose easy indifference
      and volubility in the course of the first five minutes seemed to mark him
      the most at home of the two.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom understood his father&rsquo;s thoughts, and heartily wishing he might be
      always as well disposed to give them but partial expression, began to see,
      more clearly than he had ever done before, that there might be some ground
      of offence, that there might be some reason for the glance his father gave
      towards the ceiling and stucco of the room; and that when he inquired with
      mild gravity after the fate of the billiard-table, he was not proceeding
      beyond a very allowable curiosity. A few minutes were enough for such
      unsatisfactory sensations on each side; and Sir Thomas having exerted
      himself so far as to speak a few words of calm approbation in reply to an
      eager appeal of Mr. Yates, as to the happiness of the arrangement, the
      three gentlemen returned to the drawing-room together, Sir Thomas with an
      increase of gravity which was not lost on all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I come from your theatre,&rdquo; said he composedly, as he sat down; &ldquo;I found
      myself in it rather unexpectedly. Its vicinity to my own room&mdash;but in
      every respect, indeed, it took me by surprise, as I had not the smallest
      suspicion of your acting having assumed so serious a character. It appears
      a neat job, however, as far as I could judge by candlelight, and does my
      friend Christopher Jackson credit.&rdquo; And then he would have changed the
      subject, and sipped his coffee in peace over domestic matters of a calmer
      hue; but Mr. Yates, without discernment to catch Sir Thomas&rsquo;s meaning, or
      diffidence, or delicacy, or discretion enough to allow him to lead the
      discourse while he mingled among the others with the least obtrusiveness
      himself, would keep him on the topic of the theatre, would torment him
      with questions and remarks relative to it, and finally would make him hear
      the whole history of his disappointment at Ecclesford. Sir Thomas listened
      most politely, but found much to offend his ideas of decorum, and confirm
      his ill-opinion of Mr. Yates&rsquo;s habits of thinking, from the beginning to
      the end of the story; and when it was over, could give him no other
      assurance of sympathy than what a slight bow conveyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This was, in fact, the origin of <i>our</i> acting,&rdquo; said Tom, after a
      moment&rsquo;s thought. &ldquo;My friend Yates brought the infection from Ecclesford,
      and it spread&mdash;as those things always spread, you know, sir&mdash;the
      faster, probably, from <i>your</i> having so often encouraged the sort of
      thing in us formerly. It was like treading old ground again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Yates took the subject from his friend as soon as possible, and
      immediately gave Sir Thomas an account of what they had done and were
      doing: told him of the gradual increase of their views, the happy
      conclusion of their first difficulties, and present promising state of
      affairs; relating everything with so blind an interest as made him not
      only totally unconscious of the uneasy movements of many of his friends as
      they sat, the change of countenance, the fidget, the hem! of unquietness,
      but prevented him even from seeing the expression of the face on which his
      own eyes were fixed&mdash;from seeing Sir Thomas&rsquo;s dark brow contract as
      he looked with inquiring earnestness at his daughters and Edmund, dwelling
      particularly on the latter, and speaking a language, a remonstrance, a
      reproof, which <i>he</i> felt at his heart. Not less acutely was it felt
      by Fanny, who had edged back her chair behind her aunt&rsquo;s end of the sofa,
      and, screened from notice herself, saw all that was passing before her.
      Such a look of reproach at Edmund from his father she could never have
      expected to witness; and to feel that it was in any degree deserved was an
      aggravation indeed. Sir Thomas&rsquo;s look implied, &ldquo;On your judgment, Edmund,
      I depended; what have you been about?&rdquo; She knelt in spirit to her uncle,
      and her bosom swelled to utter, &ldquo;Oh, not to <i>him</i>! Look so to all the
      others, but not to <i>him</i>!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Yates was still talking. &ldquo;To own the truth, Sir Thomas, we were in the
      middle of a rehearsal when you arrived this evening. We were going through
      the three first acts, and not unsuccessfully upon the whole. Our company
      is now so dispersed, from the Crawfords being gone home, that nothing more
      can be done to-night; but if you will give us the honour of your company
      to-morrow evening, I should not be afraid of the result. We bespeak your
      indulgence, you understand, as young performers; we bespeak your
      indulgence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My indulgence shall be given, sir,&rdquo; replied Sir Thomas gravely, &ldquo;but
      without any other rehearsal.&rdquo; And with a relenting smile, he added, &ldquo;I
      come home to be happy and indulgent.&rdquo; Then turning away towards any or all
      of the rest, he tranquilly said, &ldquo;Mr. and Miss Crawford were mentioned in
      my last letters from Mansfield. Do you find them agreeable acquaintance?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tom was the only one at all ready with an answer, but he being entirely
      without particular regard for either, without jealousy either in love or
      acting, could speak very handsomely of both. &ldquo;Mr. Crawford was a most
      pleasant, gentleman-like man; his sister a sweet, pretty, elegant, lively
      girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Rushworth could be silent no longer. &ldquo;I do not say he is not
      gentleman-like, considering; but you should tell your father he is not
      above five feet eight, or he will be expecting a well-looking man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sir Thomas did not quite understand this, and looked with some surprise at
      the speaker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I must say what I think,&rdquo; continued Mr. Rushworth, &ldquo;in my opinion it
      is very disagreeable to be always rehearsing. It is having too much of a
      good thing. I am not so fond of acting as I was at first. I think we are a
      great deal better employed, sitting comfortably here among ourselves, and
      doing nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sir Thomas looked again, and then replied with an approving smile, &ldquo;I am
      happy to find our sentiments on this subject so much the same. It gives me
      sincere satisfaction. That I should be cautious and quick-sighted, and
      feel many scruples which my children do <i>not</i> feel, is perfectly
      natural; and equally so that my value for domestic tranquillity, for a
      home which shuts out noisy pleasures, should much exceed theirs. But at
      your time of life to feel all this, is a most favourable circumstance for
      yourself, and for everybody connected with you; and I am sensible of the
      importance of having an ally of such weight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sir Thomas meant to be giving Mr. Rushworth&rsquo;s opinion in better words than
      he could find himself. He was aware that he must not expect a genius in
      Mr. Rushworth; but as a well-judging, steady young man, with better
      notions than his elocution would do justice to, he intended to value him
      very highly. It was impossible for many of the others not to smile. Mr.
      Rushworth hardly knew what to do with so much meaning; but by looking, as
      he really felt, most exceedingly pleased with Sir Thomas&rsquo;s good opinion,
      and saying scarcely anything, he did his best towards preserving that good
      opinion a little longer.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XX
    </h2>
    <p>
      Edmund&rsquo;s first object the next morning was to see his father alone, and
      give him a fair statement of the whole acting scheme, defending his own
      share in it as far only as he could then, in a soberer moment, feel his
      motives to deserve, and acknowledging, with perfect ingenuousness, that
      his concession had been attended with such partial good as to make his
      judgment in it very doubtful. He was anxious, while vindicating himself,
      to say nothing unkind of the others: but there was only one amongst them
      whose conduct he could mention without some necessity of defence or
      palliation. &ldquo;We have all been more or less to blame,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;every one
      of us, excepting Fanny. Fanny is the only one who has judged rightly
      throughout; who has been consistent. <i>Her</i> feelings have been
      steadily against it from first to last. She never ceased to think of what
      was due to you. You will find Fanny everything you could wish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sir Thomas saw all the impropriety of such a scheme among such a party,
      and at such a time, as strongly as his son had ever supposed he must; he
      felt it too much, indeed, for many words; and having shaken hands with
      Edmund, meant to try to lose the disagreeable impression, and forget how
      much he had been forgotten himself as soon as he could, after the house
      had been cleared of every object enforcing the remembrance, and restored
      to its proper state. He did not enter into any remonstrance with his other
      children: he was more willing to believe they felt their error than to run
      the risk of investigation. The reproof of an immediate conclusion of
      everything, the sweep of every preparation, would be sufficient.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was one person, however, in the house, whom he could not leave to
      learn his sentiments merely through his conduct. He could not help giving
      Mrs. Norris a hint of his having hoped that her advice might have been
      interposed to prevent what her judgment must certainly have disapproved.
      The young people had been very inconsiderate in forming the plan; they
      ought to have been capable of a better decision themselves; but they were
      young; and, excepting Edmund, he believed, of unsteady characters; and
      with greater surprise, therefore, he must regard her acquiescence in their
      wrong measures, her countenance of their unsafe amusements, than that such
      measures and such amusements should have been suggested. Mrs. Norris was a
      little confounded and as nearly being silenced as ever she had been in her
      life; for she was ashamed to confess having never seen any of the
      impropriety which was so glaring to Sir Thomas, and would not have
      admitted that her influence was insufficient&mdash;that she might have
      talked in vain. Her only resource was to get out of the subject as fast as
      possible, and turn the current of Sir Thomas&rsquo;s ideas into a happier
      channel. She had a great deal to insinuate in her own praise as to <i>general</i>
      attention to the interest and comfort of his family, much exertion and
      many sacrifices to glance at in the form of hurried walks and sudden
      removals from her own fireside, and many excellent hints of distrust and
      economy to Lady Bertram and Edmund to detail, whereby a most considerable
      saving had always arisen, and more than one bad servant been detected. But
      her chief strength lay in Sotherton. Her greatest support and glory was in
      having formed the connexion with the Rushworths. <i>There</i> she was
      impregnable. She took to herself all the credit of bringing Mr.
      Rushworth&rsquo;s admiration of Maria to any effect. &ldquo;If I had not been active,&rdquo;
       said she, &ldquo;and made a point of being introduced to his mother, and then
      prevailed on my sister to pay the first visit, I am as certain as I sit
      here that nothing would have come of it; for Mr. Rushworth is the sort of
      amiable modest young man who wants a great deal of encouragement, and
      there were girls enough on the catch for him if we had been idle. But I
      left no stone unturned. I was ready to move heaven and earth to persuade
      my sister, and at last I did persuade her. You know the distance to
      Sotherton; it was in the middle of winter, and the roads almost
      impassable, but I did persuade her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know how great, how justly great, your influence is with Lady Bertram
      and her children, and am the more concerned that it should not have been.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Sir Thomas, if you had seen the state of the roads <i>that</i>
      day! I thought we should never have got through them, though we had the
      four horses of course; and poor old coachman would attend us, out of his
      great love and kindness, though he was hardly able to sit the box on
      account of the rheumatism which I had been doctoring him for ever since
      Michaelmas. I cured him at last; but he was very bad all the winter&mdash;and
      this was such a day, I could not help going to him up in his room before
      we set off to advise him not to venture: he was putting on his wig; so I
      said, &lsquo;Coachman, you had much better not go; your Lady and I shall be very
      safe; you know how steady Stephen is, and Charles has been upon the
      leaders so often now, that I am sure there is no fear.&rsquo; But, however, I
      soon found it would not do; he was bent upon going, and as I hate to be
      worrying and officious, I said no more; but my heart quite ached for him
      at every jolt, and when we got into the rough lanes about Stoke, where,
      what with frost and snow upon beds of stones, it was worse than anything
      you can imagine, I was quite in an agony about him. And then the poor
      horses too! To see them straining away! You know how I always feel for the
      horses. And when we got to the bottom of Sandcroft Hill, what do you think
      I did? You will laugh at me; but I got out and walked up. I did indeed. It
      might not be saving them much, but it was something, and I could not bear
      to sit at my ease and be dragged up at the expense of those noble animals.
      I caught a dreadful cold, but <i>that</i> I did not regard. My object was
      accomplished in the visit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope we shall always think the acquaintance worth any trouble that
      might be taken to establish it. There is nothing very striking in Mr.
      Rushworth&rsquo;s manners, but I was pleased last night with what appeared to be
      his opinion on one subject: his decided preference of a quiet family party
      to the bustle and confusion of acting. He seemed to feel exactly as one
      could wish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, indeed, and the more you know of him the better you will like him.
      He is not a shining character, but he has a thousand good qualities; and
      is so disposed to look up to you, that I am quite laughed at about it, for
      everybody considers it as my doing. &lsquo;Upon my word, Mrs. Norris,&rsquo; said Mrs.
      Grant the other day, &lsquo;if Mr. Rushworth were a son of your own, he could
      not hold Sir Thomas in greater respect.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sir Thomas gave up the point, foiled by her evasions, disarmed by her
      flattery; and was obliged to rest satisfied with the conviction that where
      the present pleasure of those she loved was at stake, her kindness did
      sometimes overpower her judgment.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a busy morning with him. Conversation with any of them occupied but
      a small part of it. He had to reinstate himself in all the wonted concerns
      of his Mansfield life: to see his steward and his bailiff; to examine and
      compute, and, in the intervals of business, to walk into his stables and
      his gardens, and nearest plantations; but active and methodical, he had
      not only done all this before he resumed his seat as master of the house
      at dinner, he had also set the carpenter to work in pulling down what had
      been so lately put up in the billiard-room, and given the scene-painter
      his dismissal long enough to justify the pleasing belief of his being then
      at least as far off as Northampton. The scene-painter was gone, having
      spoilt only the floor of one room, ruined all the coachman&rsquo;s sponges, and
      made five of the under-servants idle and dissatisfied; and Sir Thomas was
      in hopes that another day or two would suffice to wipe away every outward
      memento of what had been, even to the destruction of every unbound copy of
      Lovers&rsquo; Vows in the house, for he was burning all that met his eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Yates was beginning now to understand Sir Thomas&rsquo;s intentions, though
      as far as ever from understanding their source. He and his friend had been
      out with their guns the chief of the morning, and Tom had taken the
      opportunity of explaining, with proper apologies for his father&rsquo;s
      particularity, what was to be expected. Mr. Yates felt it as acutely as
      might be supposed. To be a second time disappointed in the same way was an
      instance of very severe ill-luck; and his indignation was such, that had
      it not been for delicacy towards his friend, and his friend&rsquo;s youngest
      sister, he believed he should certainly attack the baronet on the
      absurdity of his proceedings, and argue him into a little more
      rationality. He believed this very stoutly while he was in Mansfield Wood,
      and all the way home; but there was a something in Sir Thomas, when they
      sat round the same table, which made Mr. Yates think it wiser to let him
      pursue his own way, and feel the folly of it without opposition. He had
      known many disagreeable fathers before, and often been struck with the
      inconveniences they occasioned, but never, in the whole course of his
      life, had he seen one of that class so unintelligibly moral, so infamously
      tyrannical as Sir Thomas. He was not a man to be endured but for his
      children&rsquo;s sake, and he might be thankful to his fair daughter Julia that
      Mr. Yates did yet mean to stay a few days longer under his roof.
    </p>
    <p>
      The evening passed with external smoothness, though almost every mind was
      ruffled; and the music which Sir Thomas called for from his daughters
      helped to conceal the want of real harmony. Maria was in a good deal of
      agitation. It was of the utmost consequence to her that Crawford should
      now lose no time in declaring himself, and she was disturbed that even a
      day should be gone by without seeming to advance that point. She had been
      expecting to see him the whole morning, and all the evening, too, was
      still expecting him. Mr. Rushworth had set off early with the great news
      for Sotherton; and she had fondly hoped for such an immediate <i>eclaircissement</i>
      as might save him the trouble of ever coming back again. But they had seen
      no one from the Parsonage, not a creature, and had heard no tidings beyond
      a friendly note of congratulation and inquiry from Mrs. Grant to Lady
      Bertram. It was the first day for many, many weeks, in which the families
      had been wholly divided. Four-and-twenty hours had never passed before,
      since August began, without bringing them together in some way or other.
      It was a sad, anxious day; and the morrow, though differing in the sort of
      evil, did by no means bring less. A few moments of feverish enjoyment were
      followed by hours of acute suffering. Henry Crawford was again in the
      house: he walked up with Dr. Grant, who was anxious to pay his respects to
      Sir Thomas, and at rather an early hour they were ushered into the
      breakfast-room, where were most of the family. Sir Thomas soon appeared,
      and Maria saw with delight and agitation the introduction of the man she
      loved to her father. Her sensations were indefinable, and so were they a
      few minutes afterwards upon hearing Henry Crawford, who had a chair
      between herself and Tom, ask the latter in an undervoice whether there
      were any plans for resuming the play after the present happy interruption
      (with a courteous glance at Sir Thomas), because, in that case, he should
      make a point of returning to Mansfield at any time required by the party:
      he was going away immediately, being to meet his uncle at Bath without
      delay; but if there were any prospect of a renewal of Lovers&rsquo; Vows, he
      should hold himself positively engaged, he should break through every
      other claim, he should absolutely condition with his uncle for attending
      them whenever he might be wanted. The play should not be lost by <i>his</i>
      absence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From Bath, Norfolk, London, York, wherever I may be,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;I will
      attend you from any place in England, at an hour&rsquo;s notice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was well at that moment that Tom had to speak, and not his sister. He
      could immediately say with easy fluency, &ldquo;I am sorry you are going; but as
      to our play, <i>that</i> is all over&mdash;entirely at an end&rdquo; (looking
      significantly at his father). &ldquo;The painter was sent off yesterday, and
      very little will remain of the theatre to-morrow. I knew how <i>that</i>
      would be from the first. It is early for Bath. You will find nobody
      there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is about my uncle&rsquo;s usual time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When do you think of going?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I may, perhaps, get as far as Banbury to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whose stables do you use at Bath?&rdquo; was the next question; and while this
      branch of the subject was under discussion, Maria, who wanted neither
      pride nor resolution, was preparing to encounter her share of it with
      tolerable calmness.
    </p>
    <p>
      To her he soon turned, repeating much of what he had already said, with
      only a softened air and stronger expressions of regret. But what availed
      his expressions or his air? He was going, and, if not voluntarily going,
      voluntarily intending to stay away; for, excepting what might be due to
      his uncle, his engagements were all self-imposed. He might talk of
      necessity, but she knew his independence. The hand which had so pressed
      hers to his heart! the hand and the heart were alike motionless and
      passive now! Her spirit supported her, but the agony of her mind was
      severe. She had not long to endure what arose from listening to language
      which his actions contradicted, or to bury the tumult of her feelings
      under the restraint of society; for general civilities soon called his
      notice from her, and the farewell visit, as it then became openly
      acknowledged, was a very short one. He was gone&mdash;he had touched her
      hand for the last time, he had made his parting bow, and she might seek
      directly all that solitude could do for her. Henry Crawford was gone, gone
      from the house, and within two hours afterwards from the parish; and so
      ended all the hopes his selfish vanity had raised in Maria and Julia
      Bertram.
    </p>
    <p>
      Julia could rejoice that he was gone. His presence was beginning to be
      odious to her; and if Maria gained him not, she was now cool enough to
      dispense with any other revenge. She did not want exposure to be added to
      desertion. Henry Crawford gone, she could even pity her sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a purer spirit did Fanny rejoice in the intelligence. She heard it at
      dinner, and felt it a blessing. By all the others it was mentioned with
      regret; and his merits honoured with due gradation of feeling&mdash;from
      the sincerity of Edmund&rsquo;s too partial regard, to the unconcern of his
      mother speaking entirely by rote. Mrs. Norris began to look about her, and
      wonder that his falling in love with Julia had come to nothing; and could
      almost fear that she had been remiss herself in forwarding it; but with so
      many to care for, how was it possible for even <i>her</i> activity to keep
      pace with her wishes?
    </p>
    <p>
      Another day or two, and Mr. Yates was gone likewise. In <i>his</i>
      departure Sir Thomas felt the chief interest: wanting to be alone with his
      family, the presence of a stranger superior to Mr. Yates must have been
      irksome; but of him, trifling and confident, idle and expensive, it was
      every way vexatious. In himself he was wearisome, but as the friend of Tom
      and the admirer of Julia he became offensive. Sir Thomas had been quite
      indifferent to Mr. Crawford&rsquo;s going or staying: but his good wishes for
      Mr. Yates&rsquo;s having a pleasant journey, as he walked with him to the
      hall-door, were given with genuine satisfaction. Mr. Yates had staid to
      see the destruction of every theatrical preparation at Mansfield, the
      removal of everything appertaining to the play: he left the house in all
      the soberness of its general character; and Sir Thomas hoped, in seeing
      him out of it, to be rid of the worst object connected with the scheme,
      and the last that must be inevitably reminding him of its existence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Norris contrived to remove one article from his sight that might have
      distressed him. The curtain, over which she had presided with such talent
      and such success, went off with her to her cottage, where she happened to
      be particularly in want of green baize.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXI
    </h2>
    <p>
      Sir Thomas&rsquo;s return made a striking change in the ways of the family,
      independent of Lovers&rsquo; Vows. Under his government, Mansfield was an
      altered place. Some members of their society sent away, and the spirits of
      many others saddened&mdash;it was all sameness and gloom compared with the
      past&mdash;a sombre family party rarely enlivened. There was little
      intercourse with the Parsonage. Sir Thomas, drawing back from intimacies
      in general, was particularly disinclined, at this time, for any
      engagements but in one quarter. The Rushworths were the only addition to
      his own domestic circle which he could solicit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Edmund did not wonder that such should be his father&rsquo;s feelings, nor could
      he regret anything but the exclusion of the Grants. &ldquo;But they,&rdquo; he observed
      to Fanny, &ldquo;have a claim. They seem to belong to us; they seem to be part
      of ourselves. I could wish my father were more sensible of their very
      great attention to my mother and sisters while he was away. I am afraid
      they may feel themselves neglected. But the truth is, that my father
      hardly knows them. They had not been here a twelvemonth when he left
      England. If he knew them better, he would value their society as it
      deserves; for they are in fact exactly the sort of people he would like.
      We are sometimes a little in want of animation among ourselves: my sisters
      seem out of spirits, and Tom is certainly not at his ease. Dr. and Mrs.
      Grant would enliven us, and make our evenings pass away with more
      enjoyment even to my father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think so?&rdquo; said Fanny: &ldquo;in my opinion, my uncle would not like <i>any</i>
      addition. I think he values the very quietness you speak of, and that the
      repose of his own family circle is all he wants. And it does not appear to
      me that we are more serious than we used to be&mdash;I mean before my
      uncle went abroad. As well as I can recollect, it was always much the
      same. There was never much laughing in his presence; or, if there is any
      difference, it is not more, I think, than such an absence has a tendency
      to produce at first. There must be a sort of shyness; but I cannot
      recollect that our evenings formerly were ever merry, except when my uncle
      was in town. No young people&rsquo;s are, I suppose, when those they look up to
      are at home&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe you are right, Fanny,&rdquo; was his reply, after a short
      consideration. &ldquo;I believe our evenings are rather returned to what they
      were, than assuming a new character. The novelty was in their being
      lively. Yet, how strong the impression that only a few weeks will give! I
      have been feeling as if we had never lived so before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose I am graver than other people,&rdquo; said Fanny. &ldquo;The evenings do
      not appear long to me. I love to hear my uncle talk of the West Indies. I
      could listen to him for an hour together. It entertains <i>me</i> more
      than many other things have done; but then I am unlike other people, I
      dare say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should you dare say <i>that</i>?&rdquo; (smiling). &ldquo;Do you want to be told
      that you are only unlike other people in being more wise and discreet? But
      when did you, or anybody, ever get a compliment from me, Fanny? Go to my
      father if you want to be complimented. He will satisfy you. Ask your uncle
      what he thinks, and you will hear compliments enough: and though they may
      be chiefly on your person, you must put up with it, and trust to his
      seeing as much beauty of mind in time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Such language was so new to Fanny that it quite embarrassed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your uncle thinks you very pretty, dear Fanny&mdash;and that is the long
      and the short of the matter. Anybody but myself would have made something
      more of it, and anybody but you would resent that you had not been thought
      very pretty before; but the truth is, that your uncle never did admire you
      till now&mdash;and now he does. Your complexion is so improved!&mdash;and
      you have gained so much countenance!&mdash;and your figure&mdash;nay,
      Fanny, do not turn away about it&mdash;it is but an uncle. If you cannot
      bear an uncle&rsquo;s admiration, what is to become of you? You must really
      begin to harden yourself to the idea of being worth looking at. You must
      try not to mind growing up into a pretty woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! don&rsquo;t talk so, don&rsquo;t talk so,&rdquo; cried Fanny, distressed by more
      feelings than he was aware of; but seeing that she was distressed, he had
      done with the subject, and only added more seriously&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your uncle is disposed to be pleased with you in every respect; and I
      only wish you would talk to him more. You are one of those who are too
      silent in the evening circle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I do talk to him more than I used. I am sure I do. Did not you hear
      me ask him about the slave-trade last night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did&mdash;and was in hopes the question would be followed up by others.
      It would have pleased your uncle to be inquired of farther.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I longed to do it&mdash;but there was such a dead silence! And while
      my cousins were sitting by without speaking a word, or seeming at all
      interested in the subject, I did not like&mdash;I thought it would appear
      as if I wanted to set myself off at their expense, by shewing a curiosity
      and pleasure in his information which he must wish his own daughters to
      feel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Crawford was very right in what she said of you the other day: that
      you seemed almost as fearful of notice and praise as other women were of
      neglect. We were talking of you at the Parsonage, and those were her
      words. She has great discernment. I know nobody who distinguishes
      characters better. For so young a woman it is remarkable! She certainly
      understands <i>you</i> better than you are understood by the greater part
      of those who have known you so long; and with regard to some others, I can
      perceive, from occasional lively hints, the unguarded expressions of the
      moment, that she could define <i>many</i> as accurately, did not delicacy
      forbid it. I wonder what she thinks of my father! She must admire him as a
      fine-looking man, with most gentlemanlike, dignified, consistent manners;
      but perhaps, having seen him so seldom, his reserve may be a little
      repulsive. Could they be much together, I feel sure of their liking each
      other. He would enjoy her liveliness and she has talents to value his
      powers. I wish they met more frequently! I hope she does not suppose there
      is any dislike on his side.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She must know herself too secure of the regard of all the rest of you,&rdquo;
       said Fanny, with half a sigh, &ldquo;to have any such apprehension. And Sir
      Thomas&rsquo;s wishing just at first to be only with his family, is so very
      natural, that she can argue nothing from that. After a little while, I
      dare say, we shall be meeting again in the same sort of way, allowing for
      the difference of the time of year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is the first October that she has passed in the country since her
      infancy. I do not call Tunbridge or Cheltenham the country; and November
      is a still more serious month, and I can see that Mrs. Grant is very
      anxious for her not finding Mansfield dull as winter comes on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fanny could have said a great deal, but it was safer to say nothing, and
      leave untouched all Miss Crawford&rsquo;s resources&mdash;her accomplishments,
      her spirits, her importance, her friends, lest it should betray her into
      any observations seemingly unhandsome. Miss Crawford&rsquo;s kind opinion of
      herself deserved at least a grateful forbearance, and she began to talk of
      something else.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow, I think, my uncle dines at Sotherton, and you and Mr. Bertram
      too. We shall be quite a small party at home. I hope my uncle may continue
      to like Mr. Rushworth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is impossible, Fanny. He must like him less after to-morrow&rsquo;s visit,
      for we shall be five hours in his company. I should dread the stupidity of
      the day, if there were not a much greater evil to follow&mdash;the
      impression it must leave on Sir Thomas. He cannot much longer deceive
      himself. I am sorry for them all, and would give something that Rushworth
      and Maria had never met.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In this quarter, indeed, disappointment was impending over Sir Thomas. Not
      all his good-will for Mr. Rushworth, not all Mr. Rushworth&rsquo;s deference for
      him, could prevent him from soon discerning some part of the truth&mdash;that
      Mr. Rushworth was an inferior young man, as ignorant in business as in
      books, with opinions in general unfixed, and without seeming much aware of
      it himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had expected a very different son-in-law; and beginning to feel grave
      on Maria&rsquo;s account, tried to understand <i>her</i> feelings. Little
      observation there was necessary to tell him that indifference was the most
      favourable state they could be in. Her behaviour to Mr. Rushworth was
      careless and cold. She could not, did not like him. Sir Thomas resolved to
      speak seriously to her. Advantageous as would be the alliance, and long
      standing and public as was the engagement, her happiness must not be
      sacrificed to it. Mr. Rushworth had, perhaps, been accepted on too short
      an acquaintance, and, on knowing him better, she was repenting.
    </p>
    <p>
      With solemn kindness Sir Thomas addressed her: told her his fears,
      inquired into her wishes, entreated her to be open and sincere, and
      assured her that every inconvenience should be braved, and the connexion
      entirely given up, if she felt herself unhappy in the prospect of it. He
      would act for her and release her. Maria had a moment&rsquo;s struggle as she
      listened, and only a moment&rsquo;s: when her father ceased, she was able to
      give her answer immediately, decidedly, and with no apparent agitation.
      She thanked him for his great attention, his paternal kindness, but he was
      quite mistaken in supposing she had the smallest desire of breaking
      through her engagement, or was sensible of any change of opinion or
      inclination since her forming it. She had the highest esteem for Mr.
      Rushworth&rsquo;s character and disposition, and could not have a doubt of her
      happiness with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Thomas was satisfied; too glad to be satisfied, perhaps, to urge the
      matter quite so far as his judgment might have dictated to others. It was
      an alliance which he could not have relinquished without pain; and thus he
      reasoned. Mr. Rushworth was young enough to improve. Mr. Rushworth must
      and would improve in good society; and if Maria could now speak so
      securely of her happiness with him, speaking certainly without the
      prejudice, the blindness of love, she ought to be believed. Her feelings,
      probably, were not acute; he had never supposed them to be so; but her
      comforts might not be less on that account; and if she could dispense with
      seeing her husband a leading, shining character, there would certainly be
      everything else in her favour. A well-disposed young woman, who did not
      marry for love, was in general but the more attached to her own family;
      and the nearness of Sotherton to Mansfield must naturally hold out the
      greatest temptation, and would, in all probability, be a continual supply
      of the most amiable and innocent enjoyments. Such and such-like were the
      reasonings of Sir Thomas, happy to escape the embarrassing evils of a
      rupture, the wonder, the reflections, the reproach that must attend it;
      happy to secure a marriage which would bring him such an addition of
      respectability and influence, and very happy to think anything of his
      daughter&rsquo;s disposition that was most favourable for the purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      To her the conference closed as satisfactorily as to him. She was in a
      state of mind to be glad that she had secured her fate beyond recall: that
      she had pledged herself anew to Sotherton; that she was safe from the
      possibility of giving Crawford the triumph of governing her actions, and
      destroying her prospects; and retired in proud resolve, determined only to
      behave more cautiously to Mr. Rushworth in future, that her father might
      not be again suspecting her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had Sir Thomas applied to his daughter within the first three or four days
      after Henry Crawford&rsquo;s leaving Mansfield, before her feelings were at all
      tranquillised, before she had given up every hope of him, or absolutely
      resolved on enduring his rival, her answer might have been different; but
      after another three or four days, when there was no return, no letter, no
      message, no symptom of a softened heart, no hope of advantage from
      separation, her mind became cool enough to seek all the comfort that pride
      and self revenge could give.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry Crawford had destroyed her happiness, but he should not know that he
      had done it; he should not destroy her credit, her appearance, her
      prosperity, too. He should not have to think of her as pining in the
      retirement of Mansfield for <i>him</i>, rejecting Sotherton and London,
      independence and splendour, for <i>his</i> sake. Independence was more
      needful than ever; the want of it at Mansfield more sensibly felt. She was
      less and less able to endure the restraint which her father imposed. The
      liberty which his absence had given was now become absolutely necessary.
      She must escape from him and Mansfield as soon as possible, and find
      consolation in fortune and consequence, bustle and the world, for a
      wounded spirit. Her mind was quite determined, and varied not.
    </p>
    <p>
      To such feelings delay, even the delay of much preparation, would have
      been an evil, and Mr. Rushworth could hardly be more impatient for the
      marriage than herself. In all the important preparations of the mind she
      was complete: being prepared for matrimony by an hatred of home,
      restraint, and tranquillity; by the misery of disappointed affection, and
      contempt of the man she was to marry. The rest might wait. The
      preparations of new carriages and furniture might wait for London and
      spring, when her own taste could have fairer play.
    </p>
    <p>
      The principals being all agreed in this respect, it soon appeared that a
      very few weeks would be sufficient for such arrangements as must precede
      the wedding.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Rushworth was quite ready to retire, and make way for the fortunate
      young woman whom her dear son had selected; and very early in November
      removed herself, her maid, her footman, and her chariot, with true dowager
      propriety, to Bath, there to parade over the wonders of Sotherton in her
      evening parties; enjoying them as thoroughly, perhaps, in the animation of
      a card-table, as she had ever done on the spot; and before the middle of
      the same month the ceremony had taken place which gave Sotherton another
      mistress.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a very proper wedding. The bride was elegantly dressed; the two
      bridesmaids were duly inferior; her father gave her away; her mother stood
      with salts in her hand, expecting to be agitated; her aunt tried to cry;
      and the service was impressively read by Dr. Grant. Nothing could be
      objected to when it came under the discussion of the neighbourhood, except
      that the carriage which conveyed the bride and bridegroom and Julia from
      the church-door to Sotherton was the same chaise which Mr. Rushworth had
      used for a twelvemonth before. In everything else the etiquette of the day
      might stand the strictest investigation.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was done, and they were gone. Sir Thomas felt as an anxious father must
      feel, and was indeed experiencing much of the agitation which his wife had
      been apprehensive of for herself, but had fortunately escaped. Mrs.
      Norris, most happy to assist in the duties of the day, by spending it at
      the Park to support her sister&rsquo;s spirits, and drinking the health of Mr.
      and Mrs. Rushworth in a supernumerary glass or two, was all joyous
      delight; for she had made the match; she had done everything; and no one
      would have supposed, from her confident triumph, that she had ever heard
      of conjugal infelicity in her life, or could have the smallest insight
      into the disposition of the niece who had been brought up under her eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      The plan of the young couple was to proceed, after a few days, to
      Brighton, and take a house there for some weeks. Every public place was
      new to Maria, and Brighton is almost as gay in winter as in summer. When
      the novelty of amusement there was over, it would be time for the wider
      range of London.
    </p>
    <p>
      Julia was to go with them to Brighton. Since rivalry between the sisters
      had ceased, they had been gradually recovering much of their former good
      understanding; and were at least sufficiently friends to make each of them
      exceedingly glad to be with the other at such a time. Some other companion
      than Mr. Rushworth was of the first consequence to his lady; and Julia was
      quite as eager for novelty and pleasure as Maria, though she might not
      have struggled through so much to obtain them, and could better bear a
      subordinate situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their departure made another material change at Mansfield, a chasm which
      required some time to fill up. The family circle became greatly
      contracted; and though the Miss Bertrams had latterly added little to its
      gaiety, they could not but be missed. Even their mother missed them; and
      how much more their tenderhearted cousin, who wandered about the house,
      and thought of them, and felt for them, with a degree of affectionate
      regret which they had never done much to deserve!

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Fanny&rsquo;s consequence increased on the departure of her cousins. Becoming,
      as she then did, the only young woman in the drawing-room, the only
      occupier of that interesting division of a family in which she had
      hitherto held so humble a third, it was impossible for her not to be more
      looked at, more thought of and attended to, than she had ever been before;
      and &ldquo;Where is Fanny?&rdquo; became no uncommon question, even without her being
      wanted for any one&rsquo;s convenience.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not only at home did her value increase, but at the Parsonage too. In that
      house, which she had hardly entered twice a year since Mr. Norris&rsquo;s death,
      she became a welcome, an invited guest, and in the gloom and dirt of a
      November day, most acceptable to Mary Crawford. Her visits there,
      beginning by chance, were continued by solicitation. Mrs. Grant, really
      eager to get any change for her sister, could, by the easiest self-deceit,
      persuade herself that she was doing the kindest thing by Fanny, and giving
      her the most important opportunities of improvement in pressing her
      frequent calls.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fanny, having been sent into the village on some errand by her aunt
      Norris, was overtaken by a heavy shower close to the Parsonage; and being
      descried from one of the windows endeavouring to find shelter under the
      branches and lingering leaves of an oak just beyond their premises, was
      forced, though not without some modest reluctance on her part, to come in.
      A civil servant she had withstood; but when Dr. Grant himself went out
      with an umbrella, there was nothing to be done but to be very much
      ashamed, and to get into the house as fast as possible; and to poor Miss
      Crawford, who had just been contemplating the dismal rain in a very
      desponding state of mind, sighing over the ruin of all her plan of
      exercise for that morning, and of every chance of seeing a single creature
      beyond themselves for the next twenty-four hours, the sound of a little
      bustle at the front door, and the sight of Miss Price dripping with wet in
      the vestibule, was delightful. The value of an event on a wet day in the
      country was most forcibly brought before her. She was all alive again
      directly, and among the most active in being useful to Fanny, in detecting
      her to be wetter than she would at first allow, and providing her with dry
      clothes; and Fanny, after being obliged to submit to all this attention,
      and to being assisted and waited on by mistresses and maids, being also
      obliged, on returning downstairs, to be fixed in their drawing-room for an
      hour while the rain continued, the blessing of something fresh to see and
      think of was thus extended to Miss Crawford, and might carry on her
      spirits to the period of dressing and dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two sisters were so kind to her, and so pleasant, that Fanny might
      have enjoyed her visit could she have believed herself not in the way, and
      could she have foreseen that the weather would certainly clear at the end
      of the hour, and save her from the shame of having Dr. Grant&rsquo;s carriage
      and horses out to take her home, with which she was threatened. As to
      anxiety for any alarm that her absence in such weather might occasion at
      home, she had nothing to suffer on that score; for as her being out was
      known only to her two aunts, she was perfectly aware that none would be
      felt, and that in whatever cottage aunt Norris might chuse to establish
      her during the rain, her being in such cottage would be indubitable to
      aunt Bertram.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was beginning to look brighter, when Fanny, observing a harp in the
      room, asked some questions about it, which soon led to an acknowledgment
      of her wishing very much to hear it, and a confession, which could hardly
      be believed, of her having never yet heard it since its being in
      Mansfield. To Fanny herself it appeared a very simple and natural
      circumstance. She had scarcely ever been at the Parsonage since the
      instrument&rsquo;s arrival, there had been no reason that she should; but Miss
      Crawford, calling to mind an early expressed wish on the subject, was
      concerned at her own neglect; and &ldquo;Shall I play to you now?&rdquo; and &ldquo;What
      will you have?&rdquo; were questions immediately following with the readiest
      good-humour.
    </p>
    <p>
      She played accordingly; happy to have a new listener, and a listener who
      seemed so much obliged, so full of wonder at the performance, and who
      shewed herself not wanting in taste. She played till Fanny&rsquo;s eyes,
      straying to the window on the weather&rsquo;s being evidently fair, spoke what
      she felt must be done.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Another quarter of an hour,&rdquo; said Miss Crawford, &ldquo;and we shall see how it
      will be. Do not run away the first moment of its holding up. Those clouds
      look alarming.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But they are passed over,&rdquo; said Fanny. &ldquo;I have been watching them. This
      weather is all from the south.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;South or north, I know a black cloud when I see it; and you must not set
      forward while it is so threatening. And besides, I want to play something
      more to you&mdash;a very pretty piece&mdash;and your cousin Edmund&rsquo;s prime
      favourite. You must stay and hear your cousin&rsquo;s favourite.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fanny felt that she must; and though she had not waited for that sentence
      to be thinking of Edmund, such a memento made her particularly awake to
      his idea, and she fancied him sitting in that room again and again,
      perhaps in the very spot where she sat now, listening with constant
      delight to the favourite air, played, as it appeared to her, with superior
      tone and expression; and though pleased with it herself, and glad to like
      whatever was liked by him, she was more sincerely impatient to go away at
      the conclusion of it than she had been before; and on this being evident,
      she was so kindly asked to call again, to take them in her walk whenever
      she could, to come and hear more of the harp, that she felt it necessary
      to be done, if no objection arose at home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was the origin of the sort of intimacy which took place between them
      within the first fortnight after the Miss Bertrams&rsquo; going away&mdash;an
      intimacy resulting principally from Miss Crawford&rsquo;s desire of something
      new, and which had little reality in Fanny&rsquo;s feelings. Fanny went to her
      every two or three days: it seemed a kind of fascination: she could not be
      easy without going, and yet it was without loving her, without ever
      thinking like her, without any sense of obligation for being sought after
      now when nobody else was to be had; and deriving no higher pleasure from
      her conversation than occasional amusement, and <i>that</i> often at the
      expense of her judgment, when it was raised by pleasantry on people or
      subjects which she wished to be respected. She went, however, and they
      sauntered about together many an half-hour in Mrs. Grant&rsquo;s shrubbery, the
      weather being unusually mild for the time of year, and venturing sometimes
      even to sit down on one of the benches now comparatively unsheltered,
      remaining there perhaps till, in the midst of some tender ejaculation of
      Fanny&rsquo;s on the sweets of so protracted an autumn, they were forced, by the
      sudden swell of a cold gust shaking down the last few yellow leaves about
      them, to jump up and walk for warmth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is pretty, very pretty,&rdquo; said Fanny, looking around her as they were
      thus sitting together one day; &ldquo;every time I come into this shrubbery I am
      more struck with its growth and beauty. Three years ago, this was nothing
      but a rough hedgerow along the upper side of the field, never thought of
      as anything, or capable of becoming anything; and now it is converted into
      a walk, and it would be difficult to say whether most valuable as a
      convenience or an ornament; and perhaps, in another three years, we may be
      forgetting&mdash;almost forgetting what it was before. How wonderful, how
      very wonderful the operations of time, and the changes of the human mind!&rdquo;
       And following the latter train of thought, she soon afterwards added: &ldquo;If
      any one faculty of our nature may be called <i>more</i> wonderful than the
      rest, I do think it is memory. There seems something more speakingly
      incomprehensible in the powers, the failures, the inequalities of memory,
      than in any other of our intelligences. The memory is sometimes so
      retentive, so serviceable, so obedient; at others, so bewildered and so
      weak; and at others again, so tyrannic, so beyond control! We are, to be
      sure, a miracle every way; but our powers of recollecting and of
      forgetting do seem peculiarly past finding out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Crawford, untouched and inattentive, had nothing to say; and Fanny,
      perceiving it, brought back her own mind to what she thought must
      interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It may seem impertinent in <i>me</i> to praise, but I must admire the
      taste Mrs. Grant has shewn in all this. There is such a quiet simplicity
      in the plan of the walk! Not too much attempted!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Miss Crawford carelessly, &ldquo;it does very well for a place of
      this sort. One does not think of extent <i>here</i>; and between
      ourselves, till I came to Mansfield, I had not imagined a country parson
      ever aspired to a shrubbery, or anything of the kind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am so glad to see the evergreens thrive!&rdquo; said Fanny, in reply. &ldquo;My
      uncle&rsquo;s gardener always says the soil here is better than his own, and so
      it appears from the growth of the laurels and evergreens in general. The
      evergreen! How beautiful, how welcome, how wonderful the evergreen! When
      one thinks of it, how astonishing a variety of nature! In some countries
      we know the tree that sheds its leaf is the variety, but that does not
      make it less amazing that the same soil and the same sun should nurture
      plants differing in the first rule and law of their existence. You will
      think me rhapsodising; but when I am out of doors, especially when I am
      sitting out of doors, I am very apt to get into this sort of wondering
      strain. One cannot fix one&rsquo;s eyes on the commonest natural production
      without finding food for a rambling fancy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To say the truth,&rdquo; replied Miss Crawford, &ldquo;I am something like the famous
      Doge at the court of Lewis XIV.; and may declare that I see no wonder in
      this shrubbery equal to seeing myself in it. If anybody had told me a year
      ago that this place would be my home, that I should be spending month
      after month here, as I have done, I certainly should not have believed
      them. I have now been here nearly five months; and, moreover, the quietest
      five months I ever passed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Too</i> quiet for you, I believe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should have thought so <i>theoretically</i> myself, but,&rdquo; and her eyes
      brightened as she spoke, &ldquo;take it all and all, I never spent so happy a
      summer. But then,&rdquo; with a more thoughtful air and lowered voice, &ldquo;there is
      no saying what it may lead to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fanny&rsquo;s heart beat quick, and she felt quite unequal to surmising or
      soliciting anything more. Miss Crawford, however, with renewed animation,
      soon went on&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am conscious of being far better reconciled to a country residence than
      I had ever expected to be. I can even suppose it pleasant to spend <i>half</i>
      the year in the country, under certain circumstances, very pleasant. An
      elegant, moderate-sized house in the centre of family connexions;
      continual engagements among them; commanding the first society in the
      neighbourhood; looked up to, perhaps, as leading it even more than those
      of larger fortune, and turning from the cheerful round of such amusements
      to nothing worse than a <i>tete-a-tete</i> with the person one feels most
      agreeable in the world. There is nothing frightful in such a picture, is
      there, Miss Price? One need not envy the new Mrs. Rushworth with such a
      home as <i>that</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Envy Mrs. Rushworth!&rdquo; was all that Fanny attempted to say. &ldquo;Come, come,
      it would be very un-handsome in us to be severe on Mrs. Rushworth, for I
      look forward to our owing her a great many gay, brilliant, happy hours. I
      expect we shall be all very much at Sotherton another year. Such a match
      as Miss Bertram has made is a public blessing; for the first pleasures of
      Mr. Rushworth&rsquo;s wife must be to fill her house, and give the best balls in
      the country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fanny was silent, and Miss Crawford relapsed into thoughtfulness, till
      suddenly looking up at the end of a few minutes, she exclaimed, &ldquo;Ah! here
      he is.&rdquo; It was not Mr. Rushworth, however, but Edmund, who then appeared
      walking towards them with Mrs. Grant. &ldquo;My sister and Mr. Bertram. I am so
      glad your eldest cousin is gone, that he may be Mr. Bertram again. There
      is something in the sound of Mr. <i>Edmund</i> Bertram so formal, so
      pitiful, so younger-brother-like, that I detest it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How differently we feel!&rdquo; cried Fanny. &ldquo;To me, the sound of <i>Mr.</i>
      Bertram is so cold and nothing-meaning, so entirely without warmth or
      character! It just stands for a gentleman, and that&rsquo;s all. But there is
      nobleness in the name of Edmund. It is a name of heroism and renown; of
      kings, princes, and knights; and seems to breathe the spirit of chivalry
      and warm affections.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I grant you the name is good in itself, and <i>Lord</i> Edmund or <i>Sir</i>
      Edmund sound delightfully; but sink it under the chill, the annihilation
      of a Mr., and Mr. Edmund is no more than Mr. John or Mr. Thomas. Well,
      shall we join and disappoint them of half their lecture upon sitting down
      out of doors at this time of year, by being up before they can begin?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Edmund met them with particular pleasure. It was the first time of his
      seeing them together since the beginning of that better acquaintance which
      he had been hearing of with great satisfaction. A friendship between two
      so very dear to him was exactly what he could have wished: and to the
      credit of the lover&rsquo;s understanding, be it stated, that he did not by any
      means consider Fanny as the only, or even as the greater gainer by such a
      friendship.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Miss Crawford, &ldquo;and do you not scold us for our imprudence?
      What do you think we have been sitting down for but to be talked to about
      it, and entreated and supplicated never to do so again?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps I might have scolded,&rdquo; said Edmund, &ldquo;if either of you had been
      sitting down alone; but while you do wrong together, I can overlook a
      great deal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They cannot have been sitting long,&rdquo; cried Mrs. Grant, &ldquo;for when I went
      up for my shawl I saw them from the staircase window, and then they were
      walking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And really,&rdquo; added Edmund, &ldquo;the day is so mild, that your sitting down
      for a few minutes can be hardly thought imprudent. Our weather must not
      always be judged by the calendar. We may sometimes take greater liberties
      in November than in May.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon my word,&rdquo; cried Miss Crawford, &ldquo;you are two of the most
      disappointing and unfeeling kind friends I ever met with! There is no
      giving you a moment&rsquo;s uneasiness. You do not know how much we have been
      suffering, nor what chills we have felt! But I have long thought Mr.
      Bertram one of the worst subjects to work on, in any little manoeuvre
      against common sense, that a woman could be plagued with. I had very
      little hope of <i>him</i> from the first; but you, Mrs. Grant, my sister,
      my own sister, I think I had a right to alarm you a little.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not flatter yourself, my dearest Mary. You have not the smallest
      chance of moving me. I have my alarms, but they are quite in a different
      quarter; and if I could have altered the weather, you would have had a
      good sharp east wind blowing on you the whole time&mdash;for here are some
      of my plants which Robert <i>will</i> leave out because the nights are so
      mild, and I know the end of it will be, that we shall have a sudden change
      of weather, a hard frost setting in all at once, taking everybody (at
      least Robert) by surprise, and I shall lose every one; and what is worse,
      cook has just been telling me that the turkey, which I particularly wished
      not to be dressed till Sunday, because I know how much more Dr. Grant
      would enjoy it on Sunday after the fatigues of the day, will not keep
      beyond to-morrow. These are something like grievances, and make me think
      the weather most unseasonably close.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The sweets of housekeeping in a country village!&rdquo; said Miss Crawford
      archly. &ldquo;Commend me to the nurseryman and the poulterer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear child, commend Dr. Grant to the deanery of Westminster or St.
      Paul&rsquo;s, and I should be as glad of your nurseryman and poulterer as you
      could be. But we have no such people in Mansfield. What would you have me
      do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! you can do nothing but what you do already: be plagued very often,
      and never lose your temper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you; but there is no escaping these little vexations, Mary, live
      where we may; and when you are settled in town and I come to see you, I
      dare say I shall find you with yours, in spite of the nurseryman and the
      poulterer, perhaps on their very account. Their remoteness and
      unpunctuality, or their exorbitant charges and frauds, will be drawing
      forth bitter lamentations.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean to be too rich to lament or to feel anything of the sort. A large
      income is the best recipe for happiness I ever heard of. It certainly may
      secure all the myrtle and turkey part of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You intend to be very rich?&rdquo; said Edmund, with a look which, to Fanny&rsquo;s
      eye, had a great deal of serious meaning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be sure. Do not you? Do not we all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot intend anything which it must be so completely beyond my power
      to command. Miss Crawford may chuse her degree of wealth. She has only to
      fix on her number of thousands a year, and there can be no doubt of their
      coming. My intentions are only not to be poor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By moderation and economy, and bringing down your wants to your income,
      and all that. I understand you&mdash;and a very proper plan it is for a
      person at your time of life, with such limited means and indifferent
      connexions. What can <i>you</i> want but a decent maintenance? You have
      not much time before you; and your relations are in no situation to do
      anything for you, or to mortify you by the contrast of their own wealth
      and consequence. Be honest and poor, by all means&mdash;but I shall not
      envy you; I do not much think I shall even respect you. I have a much
      greater respect for those that are honest and rich.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your degree of respect for honesty, rich or poor, is precisely what I
      have no manner of concern with. I do not mean to be poor. Poverty is
      exactly what I have determined against. Honesty, in the something between,
      in the middle state of worldly circumstances, is all that I am anxious for
      your not looking down on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I do look down upon it, if it might have been higher. I must look
      down upon anything contented with obscurity when it might rise to
      distinction.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how may it rise? How may my honesty at least rise to any
      distinction?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was not so very easy a question to answer, and occasioned an &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; of
      some length from the fair lady before she could add, &ldquo;You ought to be in
      parliament, or you should have gone into the army ten years ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>That</i> is not much to the purpose now; and as to my being in
      parliament, I believe I must wait till there is an especial assembly for
      the representation of younger sons who have little to live on. No, Miss
      Crawford,&rdquo; he added, in a more serious tone, &ldquo;there <i>are</i>
      distinctions which I should be miserable if I thought myself without any
      chance&mdash;absolutely without chance or possibility of obtaining&mdash;but
      they are of a different character.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A look of consciousness as he spoke, and what seemed a consciousness of
      manner on Miss Crawford&rsquo;s side as she made some laughing answer, was
      sorrowfull food for Fanny&rsquo;s observation; and finding herself quite unable
      to attend as she ought to Mrs. Grant, by whose side she was now following
      the others, she had nearly resolved on going home immediately, and only
      waited for courage to say so, when the sound of the great clock at
      Mansfield Park, striking three, made her feel that she had really been
      much longer absent than usual, and brought the previous self-inquiry of
      whether she should take leave or not just then, and how, to a very speedy
      issue. With undoubting decision she directly began her adieus; and Edmund
      began at the same time to recollect that his mother had been inquiring for
      her, and that he had walked down to the Parsonage on purpose to bring her
      back.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fanny&rsquo;s hurry increased; and without in the least expecting Edmund&rsquo;s
      attendance, she would have hastened away alone; but the general pace was
      quickened, and they all accompanied her into the house, through which it
      was necessary to pass. Dr. Grant was in the vestibule, and as they stopt
      to speak to him she found, from Edmund&rsquo;s manner, that he <i>did</i> mean
      to go with her. He too was taking leave. She could not but be thankful. In
      the moment of parting, Edmund was invited by Dr. Grant to eat his mutton
      with him the next day; and Fanny had barely time for an unpleasant feeling
      on the occasion, when Mrs. Grant, with sudden recollection, turned to her
      and asked for the pleasure of her company too. This was so new an
      attention, so perfectly new a circumstance in the events of Fanny&rsquo;s life,
      that she was all surprise and embarrassment; and while stammering out her
      great obligation, and her &ldquo;but she did not suppose it would be in her
      power,&rdquo; was looking at Edmund for his opinion and help. But Edmund,
      delighted with her having such an happiness offered, and ascertaining with
      half a look, and half a sentence, that she had no objection but on her
      aunt&rsquo;s account, could not imagine that his mother would make any
      difficulty of sparing her, and therefore gave his decided open advice that
      the invitation should be accepted; and though Fanny would not venture,
      even on his encouragement, to such a flight of audacious independence, it
      was soon settled, that if nothing were heard to the contrary, Mrs. Grant
      might expect her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you know what your dinner will be,&rdquo; said Mrs. Grant, smiling&mdash;&ldquo;the
      turkey, and I assure you a very fine one; for, my dear,&rdquo; turning to her
      husband, &ldquo;cook insists upon the turkey&rsquo;s being dressed to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, very well,&rdquo; cried Dr. Grant, &ldquo;all the better; I am glad to
      hear you have anything so good in the house. But Miss Price and Mr. Edmund
      Bertram, I dare say, would take their chance. We none of us want to hear
      the bill of fare. A friendly meeting, and not a fine dinner, is all we
      have in view. A turkey, or a goose, or a leg of mutton, or whatever you
      and your cook chuse to give us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two cousins walked home together; and, except in the immediate
      discussion of this engagement, which Edmund spoke of with the warmest
      satisfaction, as so particularly desirable for her in the intimacy which
      he saw with so much pleasure established, it was a silent walk; for having
      finished that subject, he grew thoughtful and indisposed for any other.

      CHAPTER XXIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why should Mrs. Grant ask Fanny?&rdquo; said Lady Bertram. &ldquo;How came she to
      think of asking Fanny? Fanny never dines there, you know, in this sort of
      way. I cannot spare her, and I am sure she does not want to go. Fanny, you
      do not want to go, do you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you put such a question to her,&rdquo; cried Edmund, preventing his cousin&rsquo;s
      speaking, &ldquo;Fanny will immediately say No; but I am sure, my dear mother,
      she would like to go; and I can see no reason why she should not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot imagine why Mrs. Grant should think of asking her? She never did
      before. She used to ask your sisters now and then, but she never asked
      Fanny.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you cannot do without me, ma&rsquo;am&mdash;&rdquo; said Fanny, in a self-denying
      tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But my mother will have my father with her all the evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be sure, so I shall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose you take my father&rsquo;s opinion, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s well thought of. So I will, Edmund. I will ask Sir Thomas, as soon
      as he comes in, whether I can do without her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As you please, ma&rsquo;am, on that head; but I meant my father&rsquo;s opinion as to
      the <i>propriety</i> of the invitation&rsquo;s being accepted or not; and I
      think he will consider it a right thing by Mrs. Grant, as well as by
      Fanny, that being the <i>first</i> invitation it should be accepted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not know. We will ask him. But he will be very much surprised that
      Mrs. Grant should ask Fanny at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was nothing more to be said, or that could be said to any purpose,
      till Sir Thomas were present; but the subject involving, as it did, her
      own evening&rsquo;s comfort for the morrow, was so much uppermost in Lady
      Bertram&rsquo;s mind, that half an hour afterwards, on his looking in for a
      minute in his way from his plantation to his dressing-room, she called him
      back again, when he had almost closed the door, with &ldquo;Sir Thomas, stop a
      moment&mdash;I have something to say to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her tone of calm languor, for she never took the trouble of raising her
      voice, was always heard and attended to; and Sir Thomas came back. Her
      story began; and Fanny immediately slipped out of the room; for to hear
      herself the subject of any discussion with her uncle was more than her
      nerves could bear. She was anxious, she knew&mdash;more anxious perhaps
      than she ought to be&mdash;for what was it after all whether she went or
      staid? but if her uncle were to be a great while considering and deciding,
      and with very grave looks, and those grave looks directed to her, and at
      last decide against her, she might not be able to appear properly
      submissive and indifferent. Her cause, meanwhile, went on well. It began,
      on Lady Bertram&rsquo;s part, with&mdash;&ldquo;I have something to tell you that will
      surprise you. Mrs. Grant has asked Fanny to dinner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Sir Thomas, as if waiting more to accomplish the surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Edmund wants her to go. But how can I spare her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She will be late,&rdquo; said Sir Thomas, taking out his watch; &ldquo;but what is
      your difficulty?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Edmund found himself obliged to speak and fill up the blanks in his
      mother&rsquo;s story. He told the whole; and she had only to add, &ldquo;So strange!
      for Mrs. Grant never used to ask her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But is it not very natural,&rdquo; observed Edmund, &ldquo;that Mrs. Grant should
      wish to procure so agreeable a visitor for her sister?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing can be more natural,&rdquo; said Sir Thomas, after a short
      deliberation; &ldquo;nor, were there no sister in the case, could anything, in
      my opinion, be more natural. Mrs. Grant&rsquo;s shewing civility to Miss Price,
      to Lady Bertram&rsquo;s niece, could never want explanation. The only surprise I
      can feel is, that this should be the <i>first</i> time of its being paid.
      Fanny was perfectly right in giving only a conditional answer. She appears
      to feel as she ought. But as I conclude that she must wish to go, since
      all young people like to be together, I can see no reason why she should
      be denied the indulgence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But can I do without her, Sir Thomas?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed I think you may.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She always makes tea, you know, when my sister is not here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your sister, perhaps, may be prevailed on to spend the day with us, and I
      shall certainly be at home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, then, Fanny may go, Edmund.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The good news soon followed her. Edmund knocked at her door in his way to
      his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Fanny, it is all happily settled, and without the smallest
      hesitation on your uncle&rsquo;s side. He had but one opinion. You are to go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, I am <i>so</i> glad,&rdquo; was Fanny&rsquo;s instinctive reply; though
      when she had turned from him and shut the door, she could not help
      feeling, &ldquo;And yet why should I be glad? for am I not certain of seeing or
      hearing something there to pain me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In spite of this conviction, however, she was glad. Simple as such an
      engagement might appear in other eyes, it had novelty and importance in
      hers, for excepting the day at Sotherton, she had scarcely ever dined out
      before; and though now going only half a mile, and only to three people,
      still it was dining out, and all the little interests of preparation were
      enjoyments in themselves. She had neither sympathy nor assistance from
      those who ought to have entered into her feelings and directed her taste;
      for Lady Bertram never thought of being useful to anybody, and Mrs.
      Norris, when she came on the morrow, in consequence of an early call and
      invitation from Sir Thomas, was in a very ill humour, and seemed intent
      only on lessening her niece&rsquo;s pleasure, both present and future, as much
      as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon my word, Fanny, you are in high luck to meet with such attention and
      indulgence! You ought to be very much obliged to Mrs. Grant for thinking
      of you, and to your aunt for letting you go, and you ought to look upon it
      as something extraordinary; for I hope you are aware that there is no real
      occasion for your going into company in this sort of way, or ever dining
      out at all; and it is what you must not depend upon ever being repeated.
      Nor must you be fancying that the invitation is meant as any particular
      compliment to <i>you</i>; the compliment is intended to your uncle and
      aunt and me. Mrs. Grant thinks it a civility due to <i>us</i> to take a
      little notice of you, or else it would never have come into her head, and
      you may be very certain that, if your cousin Julia had been at home, you
      would not have been asked at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Norris had now so ingeniously done away all Mrs. Grant&rsquo;s part of the
      favour, that Fanny, who found herself expected to speak, could only say
      that she was very much obliged to her aunt Bertram for sparing her, and
      that she was endeavouring to put her aunt&rsquo;s evening work in such a state
      as to prevent her being missed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! depend upon it, your aunt can do very well without you, or you would
      not be allowed to go. <i>I</i> shall be here, so you may be quite easy
      about your aunt. And I hope you will have a very <i>agreeable</i> day, and
      find it all mighty <i>delightful</i>. But I must observe that five is the
      very awkwardest of all possible numbers to sit down to table; and I cannot
      but be surprised that such an <i>elegant</i> lady as Mrs. Grant should not
      contrive better! And round their enormous great wide table, too, which
      fills up the room so dreadfully! Had the doctor been contented to take my
      dining-table when I came away, as anybody in their senses would have done,
      instead of having that absurd new one of his own, which is wider,
      literally wider than the dinner-table here, how infinitely better it would
      have been! and how much more he would have been respected! for people are
      never respected when they step out of their proper sphere. Remember that,
      Fanny. Five&mdash;only five to be sitting round that table. However, you
      will have dinner enough on it for ten, I dare say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Norris fetched breath, and went on again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The nonsense and folly of people&rsquo;s stepping out of their rank and trying
      to appear above themselves, makes me think it right to give <i>you</i> a
      hint, Fanny, now that you are going into company without any of us; and I
      do beseech and entreat you not to be putting yourself forward, and talking
      and giving your opinion as if you were one of your cousins&mdash;as if you
      were dear Mrs. Rushworth or Julia. <i>That</i> will never do, believe me.
      Remember, wherever you are, you must be the lowest and last; and though
      Miss Crawford is in a manner at home at the Parsonage, you are not to be
      taking place of her. And as to coming away at night, you are to stay just
      as long as Edmund chuses. Leave him to settle <i>that</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, ma&rsquo;am, I should not think of anything else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if it should rain, which I think exceedingly likely, for I never saw
      it more threatening for a wet evening in my life, you must manage as well
      as you can, and not be expecting the carriage to be sent for you. I
      certainly do not go home to-night, and, therefore, the carriage will not
      be out on my account; so you must make up your mind to what may happen,
      and take your things accordingly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her niece thought it perfectly reasonable. She rated her own claims to
      comfort as low even as Mrs. Norris could; and when Sir Thomas soon
      afterwards, just opening the door, said, &ldquo;Fanny, at what time would you
      have the carriage come round?&rdquo; she felt a degree of astonishment which
      made it impossible for her to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Sir Thomas!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Norris, red with anger, &ldquo;Fanny can walk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Walk!&rdquo; repeated Sir Thomas, in a tone of most unanswerable dignity, and
      coming farther into the room. &ldquo;My niece walk to a dinner engagement at
      this time of the year! Will twenty minutes after four suit you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; was Fanny&rsquo;s humble answer, given with the feelings almost of a
      criminal towards Mrs. Norris; and not bearing to remain with her in what
      might seem a state of triumph, she followed her uncle out of the room,
      having staid behind him only long enough to hear these words spoken in
      angry agitation&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite unnecessary! a great deal too kind! But Edmund goes; true, it is
      upon Edmund&rsquo;s account. I observed he was hoarse on Thursday night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But this could not impose on Fanny. She felt that the carriage was for
      herself, and herself alone: and her uncle&rsquo;s consideration of her, coming
      immediately after such representations from her aunt, cost her some tears
      of gratitude when she was alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      The coachman drove round to a minute; another minute brought down the
      gentleman; and as the lady had, with a most scrupulous fear of being late,
      been many minutes seated in the drawing-room, Sir Thomas saw them off in
      as good time as his own correctly punctual habits required.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now I must look at you, Fanny,&rdquo; said Edmund, with the kind smile of an
      affectionate brother, &ldquo;and tell you how I like you; and as well as I can
      judge by this light, you look very nicely indeed. What have you got on?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The new dress that my uncle was so good as to give me on my cousin&rsquo;s
      marriage. I hope it is not too fine; but I thought I ought to wear it as
      soon as I could, and that I might not have such another opportunity all
      the winter. I hope you do not think me too fine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A woman can never be too fine while she is all in white. No, I see no
      finery about you; nothing but what is perfectly proper. Your gown seems
      very pretty. I like these glossy spots. Has not Miss Crawford a gown
      something the same?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In approaching the Parsonage they passed close by the stable-yard and
      coach-house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heyday!&rdquo; said Edmund, &ldquo;here&rsquo;s company, here&rsquo;s a carriage! who have they
      got to meet us?&rdquo; And letting down the side-glass to distinguish, &ldquo;&lsquo;Tis
      Crawford&rsquo;s, Crawford&rsquo;s barouche, I protest! There are his own two men
      pushing it back into its old quarters. He is here, of course. This is
      quite a surprise, Fanny. I shall be very glad to see him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was no occasion, there was no time for Fanny to say how very
      differently she felt; but the idea of having such another to observe her
      was a great increase of the trepidation with which she performed the very
      awful ceremony of walking into the drawing-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the drawing-room Mr. Crawford certainly was, having been just long
      enough arrived to be ready for dinner; and the smiles and pleased looks of
      the three others standing round him, shewed how welcome was his sudden
      resolution of coming to them for a few days on leaving Bath. A very
      cordial meeting passed between him and Edmund; and with the exception of
      Fanny, the pleasure was general; and even to <i>her</i> there might be
      some advantage in his presence, since every addition to the party must
      rather forward her favourite indulgence of being suffered to sit silent
      and unattended to. She was soon aware of this herself; for though she must
      submit, as her own propriety of mind directed, in spite of her aunt
      Norris&rsquo;s opinion, to being the principal lady in company, and to all the
      little distinctions consequent thereon, she found, while they were at
      table, such a happy flow of conversation prevailing, in which she was not
      required to take any part&mdash;there was so much to be said between the
      brother and sister about Bath, so much between the two young men about
      hunting, so much of politics between Mr. Crawford and Dr. Grant, and of
      everything and all together between Mr. Crawford and Mrs. Grant, as to
      leave her the fairest prospect of having only to listen in quiet, and of
      passing a very agreeable day. She could not compliment the newly arrived
      gentleman, however, with any appearance of interest, in a scheme for
      extending his stay at Mansfield, and sending for his hunters from Norfolk,
      which, suggested by Dr. Grant, advised by Edmund, and warmly urged by the
      two sisters, was soon in possession of his mind, and which he seemed to
      want to be encouraged even by her to resolve on. Her opinion was sought as
      to the probable continuance of the open weather, but her answers were as
      short and indifferent as civility allowed. She could not wish him to stay,
      and would much rather not have him speak to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her two absent cousins, especially Maria, were much in her thoughts on
      seeing him; but no embarrassing remembrance affected <i>his</i> spirits.
      Here he was again on the same ground where all had passed before, and
      apparently as willing to stay and be happy without the Miss Bertrams, as
      if he had never known Mansfield in any other state. She heard them spoken
      of by him only in a general way, till they were all re-assembled in the
      drawing-room, when Edmund, being engaged apart in some matter of business
      with Dr. Grant, which seemed entirely to engross them, and Mrs. Grant
      occupied at the tea-table, he began talking of them with more
      particularity to his other sister. With a significant smile, which made
      Fanny quite hate him, he said, &ldquo;So! Rushworth and his fair bride are at
      Brighton, I understand; happy man!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, they have been there about a fortnight, Miss Price, have they not?
      And Julia is with them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Mr. Yates, I presume, is not far off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Yates! Oh! we hear nothing of Mr. Yates. I do not imagine he figures
      much in the letters to Mansfield Park; do you, Miss Price? I think my
      friend Julia knows better than to entertain her father with Mr. Yates.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Rushworth and his two-and-forty speeches!&rdquo; continued Crawford.
      &ldquo;Nobody can ever forget them. Poor fellow! I see him now&mdash;his toil
      and his despair. Well, I am much mistaken if his lovely Maria will ever
      want him to make two-and-forty speeches to her&rdquo;; adding, with a momentary
      seriousness, &ldquo;She is too good for him&mdash;much too good.&rdquo; And then
      changing his tone again to one of gentle gallantry, and addressing Fanny,
      he said, &ldquo;You were Mr. Rushworth&rsquo;s best friend. Your kindness and patience
      can never be forgotten, your indefatigable patience in trying to make it
      possible for him to learn his part&mdash;in trying to give him a brain
      which nature had denied&mdash;to mix up an understanding for him out of
      the superfluity of your own! <i>He</i> might not have sense enough himself
      to estimate your kindness, but I may venture to say that it had honour
      from all the rest of the party.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fanny coloured, and said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is as a dream, a pleasant dream!&rdquo; he exclaimed, breaking forth again,
      after a few minutes&rsquo; musing. &ldquo;I shall always look back on our theatricals
      with exquisite pleasure. There was such an interest, such an animation,
      such a spirit diffused. Everybody felt it. We were all alive. There was
      employment, hope, solicitude, bustle, for every hour of the day. Always
      some little objection, some little doubt, some little anxiety to be got
      over. I never was happier.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With silent indignation Fanny repeated to herself, &ldquo;Never happier!&mdash;never
      happier than when doing what you must know was not justifiable!&mdash;never
      happier than when behaving so dishonourably and unfeelingly! Oh! what a
      corrupted mind!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We were unlucky, Miss Price,&rdquo; he continued, in a lower tone, to avoid the
      possibility of being heard by Edmund, and not at all aware of her
      feelings, &ldquo;we certainly were very unlucky. Another week, only one other
      week, would have been enough for us. I think if we had had the disposal of
      events&mdash;if Mansfield Park had had the government of the winds just
      for a week or two, about the equinox, there would have been a difference.
      Not that we would have endangered his safety by any tremendous weather&mdash;but
      only by a steady contrary wind, or a calm. I think, Miss Price, we would
      have indulged ourselves with a week&rsquo;s calm in the Atlantic at that
      season.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He seemed determined to be answered; and Fanny, averting her face, said,
      with a firmer tone than usual, &ldquo;As far as <i>I</i> am concerned, sir, I
      would not have delayed his return for a day. My uncle disapproved it all
      so entirely when he did arrive, that in my opinion everything had gone
      quite far enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had never spoken so much at once to him in her life before, and never
      so angrily to any one; and when her speech was over, she trembled and
      blushed at her own daring. He was surprised; but after a few moments&rsquo; 
      silent consideration of her, replied in a calmer, graver tone, and as if
      the candid result of conviction, &ldquo;I believe you are right. It was more
      pleasant than prudent. We were getting too noisy.&rdquo; And then turning the
      conversation, he would have engaged her on some other subject, but her
      answers were so shy and reluctant that he could not advance in any.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Crawford, who had been repeatedly eyeing Dr. Grant and Edmund, now
      observed, &ldquo;Those gentlemen must have some very interesting point to
      discuss.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The most interesting in the world,&rdquo; replied her brother&mdash;&ldquo;how to
      make money; how to turn a good income into a better. Dr. Grant is giving
      Bertram instructions about the living he is to step into so soon. I find
      he takes orders in a few weeks. They were at it in the dining-parlour. I
      am glad to hear Bertram will be so well off. He will have a very pretty
      income to make ducks and drakes with, and earned without much trouble. I
      apprehend he will not have less than seven hundred a year. Seven hundred a
      year is a fine thing for a younger brother; and as of course he will still
      live at home, it will be all for his <i>menus</i> <i>plaisirs</i>; and a
      sermon at Christmas and Easter, I suppose, will be the sum total of
      sacrifice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His sister tried to laugh off her feelings by saying, &ldquo;Nothing amuses me
      more than the easy manner with which everybody settles the abundance of
      those who have a great deal less than themselves. You would look rather
      blank, Henry, if your <i>menus</i> <i>plaisirs</i> were to be limited to
      seven hundred a year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps I might; but all <i>that</i> you know is entirely comparative.
      Birthright and habit must settle the business. Bertram is certainly well
      off for a cadet of even a baronet&rsquo;s family. By the time he is four or five
      and twenty he will have seven hundred a year, and nothing to do for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Crawford <i>could</i> have said that there would be a something to do
      and to suffer for it, which she could not think lightly of; but she
      checked herself and let it pass; and tried to look calm and unconcerned
      when the two gentlemen shortly afterwards joined them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bertram,&rdquo; said Henry Crawford, &ldquo;I shall make a point of coming to
      Mansfield to hear you preach your first sermon. I shall come on purpose to
      encourage a young beginner. When is it to be? Miss Price, will not you
      join me in encouraging your cousin? Will not you engage to attend with
      your eyes steadily fixed on him the whole time&mdash;as I shall do&mdash;not
      to lose a word; or only looking off just to note down any sentence
      preeminently beautiful? We will provide ourselves with tablets and a
      pencil. When will it be? You must preach at Mansfield, you know, that Sir
      Thomas and Lady Bertram may hear you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall keep clear of you, Crawford, as long as I can,&rdquo; said Edmund; &ldquo;for
      you would be more likely to disconcert me, and I should be more sorry to
      see you trying at it than almost any other man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will he not feel this?&rdquo; thought Fanny. &ldquo;No, he can feel nothing as he
      ought.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The party being now all united, and the chief talkers attracting each
      other, she remained in tranquillity; and as a whist-table was formed after
      tea&mdash;formed really for the amusement of Dr. Grant, by his attentive
      wife, though it was not to be supposed so&mdash;and Miss Crawford took her
      harp, she had nothing to do but to listen; and her tranquillity remained
      undisturbed the rest of the evening, except when Mr. Crawford now and then
      addressed to her a question or observation, which she could not avoid
      answering. Miss Crawford was too much vexed by what had passed to be in a
      humour for anything but music. With that she soothed herself and amused
      her friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      The assurance of Edmund&rsquo;s being so soon to take orders, coming upon her
      like a blow that had been suspended, and still hoped uncertain and at a
      distance, was felt with resentment and mortification. She was very angry
      with him. She had thought her influence more. She <i>had</i> begun to
      think of him; she felt that she had, with great regard, with almost
      decided intentions; but she would now meet him with his own cool feelings.
      It was plain that he could have no serious views, no true attachment, by
      fixing himself in a situation which he must know she would never stoop to.
      She would learn to match him in his indifference. She would henceforth
      admit his attentions without any idea beyond immediate amusement. If <i>he</i>
      could so command his affections, <i>hers</i> should do her no harm.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIV
    </h2>
    <p>
      Henry Crawford had quite made up his mind by the next morning to give
      another fortnight to Mansfield, and having sent for his hunters, and
      written a few lines of explanation to the Admiral, he looked round at his
      sister as he sealed and threw the letter from him, and seeing the coast
      clear of the rest of the family, said, with a smile, &ldquo;And how do you think
      I mean to amuse myself, Mary, on the days that I do not hunt? I am grown
      too old to go out more than three times a week; but I have a plan for the
      intermediate days, and what do you think it is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To walk and ride with me, to be sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not exactly, though I shall be happy to do both, but <i>that</i> would be
      exercise only to my body, and I must take care of my mind. Besides, <i>that</i>
      would be all recreation and indulgence, without the wholesome alloy of
      labour, and I do not like to eat the bread of idleness. No, my plan is to
      make Fanny Price in love with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fanny Price! Nonsense! No, no. You ought to be satisfied with her two
      cousins.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I cannot be satisfied without Fanny Price, without making a small
      hole in Fanny Price&rsquo;s heart. You do not seem properly aware of her claims
      to notice. When we talked of her last night, you none of you seemed
      sensible of the wonderful improvement that has taken place in her looks
      within the last six weeks. You see her every day, and therefore do not
      notice it; but I assure you she is quite a different creature from what
      she was in the autumn. She was then merely a quiet, modest, not
      plain-looking girl, but she is now absolutely pretty. I used to think she
      had neither complexion nor countenance; but in that soft skin of hers, so
      frequently tinged with a blush as it was yesterday, there is decided
      beauty; and from what I observed of her eyes and mouth, I do not despair
      of their being capable of expression enough when she has anything to
      express. And then, her air, her manner, her <i>tout</i> <i>ensemble</i>,
      is so indescribably improved! She must be grown two inches, at least,
      since October.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Phoo! phoo! This is only because there were no tall women to compare her
      with, and because she has got a new gown, and you never saw her so well
      dressed before. She is just what she was in October, believe me. The truth
      is, that she was the only girl in company for you to notice, and you must
      have a somebody. I have always thought her pretty&mdash;not strikingly
      pretty&mdash;but &lsquo;pretty enough,&rsquo; as people say; a sort of beauty that
      grows on one. Her eyes should be darker, but she has a sweet smile; but as
      for this wonderful degree of improvement, I am sure it may all be resolved
      into a better style of dress, and your having nobody else to look at; and
      therefore, if you do set about a flirtation with her, you never will
      persuade me that it is in compliment to her beauty, or that it proceeds
      from anything but your own idleness and folly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her brother gave only a smile to this accusation, and soon afterwards
      said, &ldquo;I do not quite know what to make of Miss Fanny. I do not understand
      her. I could not tell what she would be at yesterday. What is her
      character? Is she solemn? Is she queer? Is she prudish? Why did she draw
      back and look so grave at me? I could hardly get her to speak. I never was
      so long in company with a girl in my life, trying to entertain her, and
      succeed so ill! Never met with a girl who looked so grave on me! I must
      try to get the better of this. Her looks say, &lsquo;I will not like you, I am
      determined not to like you&rsquo;; and I say she shall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Foolish fellow! And so this is her attraction after all! This it is, her
      not caring about you, which gives her such a soft skin, and makes her so
      much taller, and produces all these charms and graces! I do desire that
      you will not be making her really unhappy; a <i>little</i> love, perhaps,
      may animate and do her good, but I will not have you plunge her deep, for
      she is as good a little creature as ever lived, and has a great deal of
      feeling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It can be but for a fortnight,&rdquo; said Henry; &ldquo;and if a fortnight can kill
      her, she must have a constitution which nothing could save. No, I will not
      do her any harm, dear little soul! only want her to look kindly on me, to
      give me smiles as well as blushes, to keep a chair for me by herself
      wherever we are, and be all animation when I take it and talk to her; to
      think as I think, be interested in all my possessions and pleasures, try
      to keep me longer at Mansfield, and feel when I go away that she shall be
      never happy again. I want nothing more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Moderation itself!&rdquo; said Mary. &ldquo;I can have no scruples now. Well, you
      will have opportunities enough of endeavouring to recommend yourself, for
      we are a great deal together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And without attempting any farther remonstrance, she left Fanny to her
      fate, a fate which, had not Fanny&rsquo;s heart been guarded in a way
      unsuspected by Miss Crawford, might have been a little harder than she
      deserved; for although there doubtless are such unconquerable young ladies
      of eighteen (or one should not read about them) as are never to be
      persuaded into love against their judgment by all that talent, manner,
      attention, and flattery can do, I have no inclination to believe Fanny one
      of them, or to think that with so much tenderness of disposition, and so
      much taste as belonged to her, she could have escaped heart-whole from the
      courtship (though the courtship only of a fortnight) of such a man as
      Crawford, in spite of there being some previous ill opinion of him to be
      overcome, had not her affection been engaged elsewhere. With all the
      security which love of another and disesteem of him could give to the
      peace of mind he was attacking, his continued attentions&mdash;continued,
      but not obtrusive, and adapting themselves more and more to the gentleness
      and delicacy of her character&mdash;obliged her very soon to dislike him
      less than formerly. She had by no means forgotten the past, and she
      thought as ill of him as ever; but she felt his powers: he was
      entertaining; and his manners were so improved, so polite, so seriously
      and blamelessly polite, that it was impossible not to be civil to him in
      return.
    </p>
    <p>
      A very few days were enough to effect this; and at the end of those few
      days, circumstances arose which had a tendency rather to forward his views
      of pleasing her, inasmuch as they gave her a degree of happiness which
      must dispose her to be pleased with everybody. William, her brother, the
      so long absent and dearly loved brother, was in England again. She had a
      letter from him herself, a few hurried happy lines, written as the ship
      came up Channel, and sent into Portsmouth with the first boat that left
      the Antwerp at anchor in Spithead; and when Crawford walked up with the
      newspaper in his hand, which he had hoped would bring the first tidings,
      he found her trembling with joy over this letter, and listening with a
      glowing, grateful countenance to the kind invitation which her uncle was
      most collectedly dictating in reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was but the day before that Crawford had made himself thoroughly master
      of the subject, or had in fact become at all aware of her having such a
      brother, or his being in such a ship, but the interest then excited had
      been very properly lively, determining him on his return to town to apply
      for information as to the probable period of the Antwerp&rsquo;s return from the
      Mediterranean, etc.; and the good luck which attended his early
      examination of ship news the next morning seemed the reward of his
      ingenuity in finding out such a method of pleasing her, as well as of his
      dutiful attention to the Admiral, in having for many years taken in the
      paper esteemed to have the earliest naval intelligence. He proved,
      however, to be too late. All those fine first feelings, of which he had
      hoped to be the exciter, were already given. But his intention, the
      kindness of his intention, was thankfully acknowledged: quite thankfully
      and warmly, for she was elevated beyond the common timidity of her mind by
      the flow of her love for William.
    </p>
    <p>
      This dear William would soon be amongst them. There could be no doubt of
      his obtaining leave of absence immediately, for he was still only a
      midshipman; and as his parents, from living on the spot, must already have
      seen him, and be seeing him perhaps daily, his direct holidays might with
      justice be instantly given to the sister, who had been his best
      correspondent through a period of seven years, and the uncle who had done
      most for his support and advancement; and accordingly the reply to her
      reply, fixing a very early day for his arrival, came as soon as possible;
      and scarcely ten days had passed since Fanny had been in the agitation of
      her first dinner-visit, when she found herself in an agitation of a higher
      nature, watching in the hall, in the lobby, on the stairs, for the first
      sound of the carriage which was to bring her a brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      It came happily while she was thus waiting; and there being neither
      ceremony nor fearfulness to delay the moment of meeting, she was with him
      as he entered the house, and the first minutes of exquisite feeling had no
      interruption and no witnesses, unless the servants chiefly intent upon
      opening the proper doors could be called such. This was exactly what Sir
      Thomas and Edmund had been separately conniving at, as each proved to the
      other by the sympathetic alacrity with which they both advised Mrs.
      Norris&rsquo;s continuing where she was, instead of rushing out into the hall as
      soon as the noises of the arrival reached them.
    </p>
    <p>
      William and Fanny soon shewed themselves; and Sir Thomas had the pleasure
      of receiving, in his protege, certainly a very different person from the
      one he had equipped seven years ago, but a young man of an open, pleasant
      countenance, and frank, unstudied, but feeling and respectful manners, and
      such as confirmed him his friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was long before Fanny could recover from the agitating happiness of
      such an hour as was formed by the last thirty minutes of expectation, and
      the first of fruition; it was some time even before her happiness could be
      said to make her happy, before the disappointment inseparable from the
      alteration of person had vanished, and she could see in him the same
      William as before, and talk to him, as her heart had been yearning to do
      through many a past year. That time, however, did gradually come,
      forwarded by an affection on his side as warm as her own, and much less
      encumbered by refinement or self-distrust. She was the first object of his
      love, but it was a love which his stronger spirits, and bolder temper,
      made it as natural for him to express as to feel. On the morrow they were
      walking about together with true enjoyment, and every succeeding morrow
      renewed a <i>tete-a-tete</i> which Sir Thomas could not but observe with
      complacency, even before Edmund had pointed it out to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Excepting the moments of peculiar delight, which any marked or
      unlooked-for instance of Edmund&rsquo;s consideration of her in the last few
      months had excited, Fanny had never known so much felicity in her life, as
      in this unchecked, equal, fearless intercourse with the brother and friend
      who was opening all his heart to her, telling her all his hopes and fears,
      plans, and solicitudes respecting that long thought of, dearly earned, and
      justly valued blessing of promotion; who could give her direct and minute
      information of the father and mother, brothers and sisters, of whom she
      very seldom heard; who was interested in all the comforts and all the
      little hardships of her home at Mansfield; ready to think of every member
      of that home as she directed, or differing only by a less scrupulous
      opinion, and more noisy abuse of their aunt Norris, and with whom (perhaps
      the dearest indulgence of the whole) all the evil and good of their
      earliest years could be gone over again, and every former united pain and
      pleasure retraced with the fondest recollection. An advantage this, a
      strengthener of love, in which even the conjugal tie is beneath the
      fraternal. Children of the same family, the same blood, with the same
      first associations and habits, have some means of enjoyment in their
      power, which no subsequent connexions can supply; and it must be by a long
      and unnatural estrangement, by a divorce which no subsequent connexion can
      justify, if such precious remains of the earliest attachments are ever
      entirely outlived. Too often, alas! it is so. Fraternal love, sometimes
      almost everything, is at others worse than nothing. But with William and
      Fanny Price it was still a sentiment in all its prime and freshness,
      wounded by no opposition of interest, cooled by no separate attachment,
      and feeling the influence of time and absence only in its increase.
    </p>
    <p>
      An affection so amiable was advancing each in the opinion of all who had
      hearts to value anything good. Henry Crawford was as much struck with it
      as any. He honoured the warm-hearted, blunt fondness of the young sailor,
      which led him to say, with his hands stretched towards Fanny&rsquo;s head, &ldquo;Do
      you know, I begin to like that queer fashion already, though when I first
      heard of such things being done in England, I could not believe it; and
      when Mrs. Brown, and the other women at the Commissioner&rsquo;s at Gibraltar,
      appeared in the same trim, I thought they were mad; but Fanny can
      reconcile me to anything&rdquo;; and saw, with lively admiration, the glow of
      Fanny&rsquo;s cheek, the brightness of her eye, the deep interest, the absorbed
      attention, while her brother was describing any of the imminent hazards,
      or terrific scenes, which such a period at sea must supply.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a picture which Henry Crawford had moral taste enough to value.
      Fanny&rsquo;s attractions increased&mdash;increased twofold; for the sensibility
      which beautified her complexion and illumined her countenance was an
      attraction in itself. He was no longer in doubt of the capabilities of her
      heart. She had feeling, genuine feeling. It would be something to be loved
      by such a girl, to excite the first ardours of her young unsophisticated
      mind! She interested him more than he had foreseen. A fortnight was not
      enough. His stay became indefinite.
    </p>
    <p>
      William was often called on by his uncle to be the talker. His recitals
      were amusing in themselves to Sir Thomas, but the chief object in seeking
      them was to understand the reciter, to know the young man by his
      histories; and he listened to his clear, simple, spirited details with
      full satisfaction, seeing in them the proof of good principles,
      professional knowledge, energy, courage, and cheerfulness, everything that
      could deserve or promise well. Young as he was, William had already seen a
      great deal. He had been in the Mediterranean; in the West Indies; in the
      Mediterranean again; had been often taken on shore by the favour of his
      captain, and in the course of seven years had known every variety of
      danger which sea and war together could offer. With such means in his
      power he had a right to be listened to; and though Mrs. Norris could
      fidget about the room, and disturb everybody in quest of two needlefuls of
      thread or a second-hand shirt button, in the midst of her nephew&rsquo;s account
      of a shipwreck or an engagement, everybody else was attentive; and even
      Lady Bertram could not hear of such horrors unmoved, or without sometimes
      lifting her eyes from her work to say, &ldquo;Dear me! how disagreeable! I
      wonder anybody can ever go to sea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To Henry Crawford they gave a different feeling. He longed to have been at
      sea, and seen and done and suffered as much. His heart was warmed, his
      fancy fired, and he felt the highest respect for a lad who, before he was
      twenty, had gone through such bodily hardships and given such proofs of
      mind. The glory of heroism, of usefulness, of exertion, of endurance, made
      his own habits of selfish indulgence appear in shameful contrast; and he
      wished he had been a William Price, distinguishing himself and working his
      way to fortune and consequence with so much self-respect and happy ardour,
      instead of what he was!
    </p>
    <p>
      The wish was rather eager than lasting. He was roused from the reverie of
      retrospection and regret produced by it, by some inquiry from Edmund as to
      his plans for the next day&rsquo;s hunting; and he found it was as well to be a
      man of fortune at once with horses and grooms at his command. In one
      respect it was better, as it gave him the means of conferring a kindness
      where he wished to oblige. With spirits, courage, and curiosity up to
      anything, William expressed an inclination to hunt; and Crawford could
      mount him without the slightest inconvenience to himself, and with only
      some scruples to obviate in Sir Thomas, who knew better than his nephew
      the value of such a loan, and some alarms to reason away in Fanny. She
      feared for William; by no means convinced by all that he could relate of
      his own horsemanship in various countries, of the scrambling parties in
      which he had been engaged, the rough horses and mules he had ridden, or
      his many narrow escapes from dreadful falls, that he was at all equal to
      the management of a high-fed hunter in an English fox-chase; nor till he
      returned safe and well, without accident or discredit, could she be
      reconciled to the risk, or feel any of that obligation to Mr. Crawford for
      lending the horse which he had fully intended it should produce. When it
      was proved, however, to have done William no harm, she could allow it to
      be a kindness, and even reward the owner with a smile when the animal was
      one minute tendered to his use again; and the next, with the greatest
      cordiality, and in a manner not to be resisted, made over to his use
      entirely so long as he remained in Northamptonshire.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXV
    </h2>
    <p>
      The intercourse of the two families was at this period more nearly
      restored to what it had been in the autumn, than any member of the old
      intimacy had thought ever likely to be again. The return of Henry
      Crawford, and the arrival of William Price, had much to do with it, but
      much was still owing to Sir Thomas&rsquo;s more than toleration of the
      neighbourly attempts at the Parsonage. His mind, now disengaged from the
      cares which had pressed on him at first, was at leisure to find the Grants
      and their young inmates really worth visiting; and though infinitely above
      scheming or contriving for any the most advantageous matrimonial
      establishment that could be among the apparent possibilities of any one
      most dear to him, and disdaining even as a littleness the being
      quick-sighted on such points, he could not avoid perceiving, in a grand
      and careless way, that Mr. Crawford was somewhat distinguishing his niece&mdash;nor
      perhaps refrain (though unconsciously) from giving a more willing assent
      to invitations on that account.
    </p>
    <p>
      His readiness, however, in agreeing to dine at the Parsonage, when the
      general invitation was at last hazarded, after many debates and many
      doubts as to whether it were worth while, &ldquo;because Sir Thomas seemed so
      ill inclined, and Lady Bertram was so indolent!&rdquo; proceeded from
      good-breeding and goodwill alone, and had nothing to do with Mr. Crawford,
      but as being one in an agreeable group: for it was in the course of that
      very visit that he first began to think that any one in the habit of such
      idle observations <i>would</i> <i>have</i> <i>thought</i> that Mr.
      Crawford was the admirer of Fanny Price.
    </p>
    <p>
      The meeting was generally felt to be a pleasant one, being composed in a
      good proportion of those who would talk and those who would listen; and
      the dinner itself was elegant and plentiful, according to the usual style
      of the Grants, and too much according to the usual habits of all to raise
      any emotion except in Mrs. Norris, who could never behold either the wide
      table or the number of dishes on it with patience, and who did always
      contrive to experience some evil from the passing of the servants behind
      her chair, and to bring away some fresh conviction of its being impossible
      among so many dishes but that some must be cold.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the evening it was found, according to the predetermination of Mrs.
      Grant and her sister, that after making up the whist-table there would
      remain sufficient for a round game, and everybody being as perfectly
      complying and without a choice as on such occasions they always are,
      speculation was decided on almost as soon as whist; and Lady Bertram soon
      found herself in the critical situation of being applied to for her own
      choice between the games, and being required either to draw a card for
      whist or not. She hesitated. Luckily Sir Thomas was at hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What shall I do, Sir Thomas? Whist and speculation; which will amuse me
      most?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sir Thomas, after a moment&rsquo;s thought, recommended speculation. He was a
      whist player himself, and perhaps might feel that it would not much amuse
      him to have her for a partner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; was her ladyship&rsquo;s contented answer; &ldquo;then speculation, if
      you please, Mrs. Grant. I know nothing about it, but Fanny must teach me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here Fanny interposed, however, with anxious protestations of her own
      equal ignorance; she had never played the game nor seen it played in her
      life; and Lady Bertram felt a moment&rsquo;s indecision again; but upon
      everybody&rsquo;s assuring her that nothing could be so easy, that it was the
      easiest game on the cards, and Henry Crawford&rsquo;s stepping forward with a
      most earnest request to be allowed to sit between her ladyship and Miss
      Price, and teach them both, it was so settled; and Sir Thomas, Mrs.
      Norris, and Dr. and Mrs. Grant being seated at the table of prime
      intellectual state and dignity, the remaining six, under Miss Crawford&rsquo;s
      direction, were arranged round the other. It was a fine arrangement for
      Henry Crawford, who was close to Fanny, and with his hands full of
      business, having two persons&rsquo; cards to manage as well as his own; for
      though it was impossible for Fanny not to feel herself mistress of the
      rules of the game in three minutes, he had yet to inspirit her play,
      sharpen her avarice, and harden her heart, which, especially in any
      competition with William, was a work of some difficulty; and as for Lady
      Bertram, he must continue in charge of all her fame and fortune through
      the whole evening; and if quick enough to keep her from looking at her
      cards when the deal began, must direct her in whatever was to be done with
      them to the end of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was in high spirits, doing everything with happy ease, and preeminent
      in all the lively turns, quick resources, and playful impudence that could
      do honour to the game; and the round table was altogether a very
      comfortable contrast to the steady sobriety and orderly silence of the
      other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Twice had Sir Thomas inquired into the enjoyment and success of his lady,
      but in vain; no pause was long enough for the time his measured manner
      needed; and very little of her state could be known till Mrs. Grant was
      able, at the end of the first rubber, to go to her and pay her
      compliments.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope your ladyship is pleased with the game.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh dear, yes! very entertaining indeed. A very odd game. I do not know
      what it is all about. I am never to see my cards; and Mr. Crawford does
      all the rest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bertram,&rdquo; said Crawford, some time afterwards, taking the opportunity of
      a little languor in the game, &ldquo;I have never told you what happened to me
      yesterday in my ride home.&rdquo; They had been hunting together, and were in
      the midst of a good run, and at some distance from Mansfield, when his
      horse being found to have flung a shoe, Henry Crawford had been obliged to
      give up, and make the best of his way back. &ldquo;I told you I lost my way
      after passing that old farmhouse with the yew-trees, because I can never
      bear to ask; but I have not told you that, with my usual luck&mdash;for I
      never do wrong without gaining by it&mdash;I found myself in due time in
      the very place which I had a curiosity to see. I was suddenly, upon
      turning the corner of a steepish downy field, in the midst of a retired
      little village between gently rising hills; a small stream before me to be
      forded, a church standing on a sort of knoll to my right&mdash;which
      church was strikingly large and handsome for the place, and not a
      gentleman or half a gentleman&rsquo;s house to be seen excepting one&mdash;to be
      presumed the Parsonage&mdash;within a stone&rsquo;s throw of the said knoll and
      church. I found myself, in short, in Thornton Lacey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It sounds like it,&rdquo; said Edmund; &ldquo;but which way did you turn after
      passing Sewell&rsquo;s farm?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I answer no such irrelevant and insidious questions; though were I to
      answer all that you could put in the course of an hour, you would never be
      able to prove that it was <i>not</i> Thornton Lacey&mdash;for such it
      certainly was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You inquired, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I never inquire. But I <i>told</i> a man mending a hedge that it was
      Thornton Lacey, and he agreed to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have a good memory. I had forgotten having ever told you half so much
      of the place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thornton Lacey was the name of his impending living, as Miss Crawford well
      knew; and her interest in a negotiation for William Price&rsquo;s knave
      increased.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; continued Edmund, &ldquo;and how did you like what you saw?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very much indeed. You are a lucky fellow. There will be work for five
      summers at least before the place is liveable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, not so bad as that. The farmyard must be moved, I grant you; but
      I am not aware of anything else. The house is by no means bad, and when
      the yard is removed, there may be a very tolerable approach to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The farmyard must be cleared away entirely, and planted up to shut out
      the blacksmith&rsquo;s shop. The house must be turned to front the east instead
      of the north&mdash;the entrance and principal rooms, I mean, must be on
      that side, where the view is really very pretty; I am sure it may be done.
      And <i>there</i> must be your approach, through what is at present the
      garden. You must make a new garden at what is now the back of the house;
      which will be giving it the best aspect in the world, sloping to the
      south-east. The ground seems precisely formed for it. I rode fifty yards
      up the lane, between the church and the house, in order to look about me;
      and saw how it might all be. Nothing can be easier. The meadows beyond
      what <i>will</i> <i>be</i> the garden, as well as what now <i>is</i>,
      sweeping round from the lane I stood in to the north-east, that is, to the
      principal road through the village, must be all laid together, of course;
      very pretty meadows they are, finely sprinkled with timber. They belong to
      the living, I suppose; if not, you must purchase them. Then the stream&mdash;something
      must be done with the stream; but I could not quite determine what. I had
      two or three ideas.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I have two or three ideas also,&rdquo; said Edmund, &ldquo;and one of them is,
      that very little of your plan for Thornton Lacey will ever be put in
      practice. I must be satisfied with rather less ornament and beauty. I
      think the house and premises may be made comfortable, and given the air of
      a gentleman&rsquo;s residence, without any very heavy expense, and that must
      suffice me; and, I hope, may suffice all who care about me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Crawford, a little suspicious and resentful of a certain tone of
      voice, and a certain half-look attending the last expression of his hope,
      made a hasty finish of her dealings with William Price; and securing his
      knave at an exorbitant rate, exclaimed, &ldquo;There, I will stake my last like
      a woman of spirit. No cold prudence for me. I am not born to sit still and
      do nothing. If I lose the game, it shall not be from not striving for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The game was hers, and only did not pay her for what she had given to
      secure it. Another deal proceeded, and Crawford began again about Thornton
      Lacey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My plan may not be the best possible: I had not many minutes to form it
      in; but you must do a good deal. The place deserves it, and you will find
      yourself not satisfied with much less than it is capable of. (Excuse me,
      your ladyship must not see your cards. There, let them lie just before
      you.) The place deserves it, Bertram. You talk of giving it the air of a
      gentleman&rsquo;s residence. <i>That</i> will be done by the removal of the
      farmyard; for, independent of that terrible nuisance, I never saw a house
      of the kind which had in itself so much the air of a gentleman&rsquo;s
      residence, so much the look of a something above a mere parsonage-house&mdash;above
      the expenditure of a few hundreds a year. It is not a scrambling
      collection of low single rooms, with as many roofs as windows; it is not
      cramped into the vulgar compactness of a square farmhouse: it is a solid,
      roomy, mansion-like looking house, such as one might suppose a respectable
      old country family had lived in from generation to generation, through two
      centuries at least, and were now spending from two to three thousand a
      year in.&rdquo; Miss Crawford listened, and Edmund agreed to this. &ldquo;The air of a
      gentleman&rsquo;s residence, therefore, you cannot but give it, if you do
      anything. But it is capable of much more. (Let me see, Mary; Lady Bertram
      bids a dozen for that queen; no, no, a dozen is more than it is worth.
      Lady Bertram does not bid a dozen. She will have nothing to say to it. Go
      on, go on.) By some such improvements as I have suggested (I do not really
      require you to proceed upon my plan, though, by the bye, I doubt anybody&rsquo;s
      striking out a better) you may give it a higher character. You may raise
      it into a <i>place</i>. From being the mere gentleman&rsquo;s residence, it
      becomes, by judicious improvement, the residence of a man of education,
      taste, modern manners, good connexions. All this may be stamped on it; and
      that house receive such an air as to make its owner be set down as the
      great landholder of the parish by every creature travelling the road;
      especially as there is no real squire&rsquo;s house to dispute the point&mdash;a
      circumstance, between ourselves, to enhance the value of such a situation
      in point of privilege and independence beyond all calculation. <i>You</i>
      think with me, I hope&rdquo; (turning with a softened voice to Fanny). &ldquo;Have you
      ever seen the place?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fanny gave a quick negative, and tried to hide her interest in the subject
      by an eager attention to her brother, who was driving as hard a bargain,
      and imposing on her as much as he could; but Crawford pursued with &ldquo;No,
      no, you must not part with the queen. You have bought her too dearly, and
      your brother does not offer half her value. No, no, sir, hands off, hands
      off. Your sister does not part with the queen. She is quite determined.
      The game will be yours,&rdquo; turning to her again; &ldquo;it will certainly be
      yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Fanny had much rather it were William&rsquo;s,&rdquo; said Edmund, smiling at
      her. &ldquo;Poor Fanny! not allowed to cheat herself as she wishes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Bertram,&rdquo; said Miss Crawford, a few minutes afterwards, &ldquo;you know
      Henry to be such a capital improver, that you cannot possibly engage in
      anything of the sort at Thornton Lacey without accepting his help. Only
      think how useful he was at Sotherton! Only think what grand things were
      produced there by our all going with him one hot day in August to drive
      about the grounds, and see his genius take fire. There we went, and there
      we came home again; and what was done there is not to be told!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fanny&rsquo;s eyes were turned on Crawford for a moment with an expression more
      than grave&mdash;even reproachful; but on catching his, were instantly
      withdrawn. With something of consciousness he shook his head at his
      sister, and laughingly replied, &ldquo;I cannot say there was much done at
      Sotherton; but it was a hot day, and we were all walking after each other,
      and bewildered.&rdquo; As soon as a general buzz gave him shelter, he added, in
      a low voice, directed solely at Fanny, &ldquo;I should be sorry to have my
      powers of <i>planning</i> judged of by the day at Sotherton. I see things
      very differently now. Do not think of me as I appeared then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sotherton was a word to catch Mrs. Norris, and being just then in the
      happy leisure which followed securing the odd trick by Sir Thomas&rsquo;s
      capital play and her own against Dr. and Mrs. Grant&rsquo;s great hands, she
      called out, in high good-humour, &ldquo;Sotherton! Yes, that is a place, indeed,
      and we had a charming day there. William, you are quite out of luck; but
      the next time you come, I hope dear Mr. and Mrs. Rushworth will be at
      home, and I am sure I can answer for your being kindly received by both.
      Your cousins are not of a sort to forget their relations, and Mr.
      Rushworth is a most amiable man. They are at Brighton now, you know; in
      one of the best houses there, as Mr. Rushworth&rsquo;s fine fortune gives them a
      right to be. I do not exactly know the distance, but when you get back to
      Portsmouth, if it is not very far off, you ought to go over and pay your
      respects to them; and I could send a little parcel by you that I want to
      get conveyed to your cousins.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should be very happy, aunt; but Brighton is almost by Beachey Head; and
      if I could get so far, I could not expect to be welcome in such a smart
      place as that&mdash;poor scrubby midshipman as I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Norris was beginning an eager assurance of the affability he might
      depend on, when she was stopped by Sir Thomas&rsquo;s saying with authority, &ldquo;I
      do not advise your going to Brighton, William, as I trust you may soon
      have more convenient opportunities of meeting; but my daughters would be
      happy to see their cousins anywhere; and you will find Mr. Rushworth most
      sincerely disposed to regard all the connexions of our family as his own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would rather find him private secretary to the First Lord than anything
      else,&rdquo; was William&rsquo;s only answer, in an undervoice, not meant to reach
      far, and the subject dropped.
    </p>
    <p>
      As yet Sir Thomas had seen nothing to remark in Mr. Crawford&rsquo;s behaviour;
      but when the whist-table broke up at the end of the second rubber, and
      leaving Dr. Grant and Mrs. Norris to dispute over their last play, he
      became a looker-on at the other, he found his niece the object of
      attentions, or rather of professions, of a somewhat pointed character.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry Crawford was in the first glow of another scheme about Thornton
      Lacey; and not being able to catch Edmund&rsquo;s ear, was detailing it to his
      fair neighbour with a look of considerable earnestness. His scheme was to
      rent the house himself the following winter, that he might have a home of
      his own in that neighbourhood; and it was not merely for the use of it in
      the hunting-season (as he was then telling her), though <i>that</i>
      consideration had certainly some weight, feeling as he did that, in spite
      of all Dr. Grant&rsquo;s very great kindness, it was impossible for him and his
      horses to be accommodated where they now were without material
      inconvenience; but his attachment to that neighbourhood did not depend
      upon one amusement or one season of the year: he had set his heart upon
      having a something there that he could come to at any time, a little
      homestall at his command, where all the holidays of his year might be
      spent, and he might find himself continuing, improving, and <i>perfecting</i>
      that friendship and intimacy with the Mansfield Park family which was
      increasing in value to him every day. Sir Thomas heard and was not
      offended. There was no want of respect in the young man&rsquo;s address; and
      Fanny&rsquo;s reception of it was so proper and modest, so calm and uninviting,
      that he had nothing to censure in her. She said little, assented only here
      and there, and betrayed no inclination either of appropriating any part of
      the compliment to herself, or of strengthening his views in favour of
      Northamptonshire. Finding by whom he was observed, Henry Crawford
      addressed himself on the same subject to Sir Thomas, in a more everyday
      tone, but still with feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to be your neighbour, Sir Thomas, as you have, perhaps, heard me
      telling Miss Price. May I hope for your acquiescence, and for your not
      influencing your son against such a tenant?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sir Thomas, politely bowing, replied, &ldquo;It is the only way, sir, in which I
      could <i>not</i> wish you established as a permanent neighbour; but I
      hope, and believe, that Edmund will occupy his own house at Thornton
      Lacey. Edmund, am I saying too much?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Edmund, on this appeal, had first to hear what was going on; but, on
      understanding the question, was at no loss for an answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, sir, I have no idea but of residence. But, Crawford, though I
      refuse you as a tenant, come to me as a friend. Consider the house as half
      your own every winter, and we will add to the stables on your own improved
      plan, and with all the improvements of your improved plan that may occur
      to you this spring.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall be the losers,&rdquo; continued Sir Thomas. &ldquo;His going, though only
      eight miles, will be an unwelcome contraction of our family circle; but I
      should have been deeply mortified if any son of mine could reconcile
      himself to doing less. It is perfectly natural that you should not have
      thought much on the subject, Mr. Crawford. But a parish has wants and
      claims which can be known only by a clergyman constantly resident, and
      which no proxy can be capable of satisfying to the same extent. Edmund
      might, in the common phrase, do the duty of Thornton, that is, he might
      read prayers and preach, without giving up Mansfield Park: he might ride
      over every Sunday, to a house nominally inhabited, and go through divine
      service; he might be the clergyman of Thornton Lacey every seventh day,
      for three or four hours, if that would content him. But it will not. He
      knows that human nature needs more lessons than a weekly sermon can
      convey; and that if he does not live among his parishioners, and prove
      himself, by constant attention, their well-wisher and friend, he does very
      little either for their good or his own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Crawford bowed his acquiescence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I repeat again,&rdquo; added Sir Thomas, &ldquo;that Thornton Lacey is the only house
      in the neighbourhood in which I should <i>not</i> be happy to wait on Mr.
      Crawford as occupier.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Crawford bowed his thanks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir Thomas,&rdquo; said Edmund, &ldquo;undoubtedly understands the duty of a parish
      priest. We must hope his son may prove that <i>he</i> knows it too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Whatever effect Sir Thomas&rsquo;s little harangue might really produce on Mr.
      Crawford, it raised some awkward sensations in two of the others, two of
      his most attentive listeners&mdash;Miss Crawford and Fanny. One of whom,
      having never before understood that Thornton was so soon and so completely
      to be his home, was pondering with downcast eyes on what it would be <i>not</i>
      to see Edmund every day; and the other, startled from the agreeable
      fancies she had been previously indulging on the strength of her brother&rsquo;s
      description, no longer able, in the picture she had been forming of a
      future Thornton, to shut out the church, sink the clergyman, and see only
      the respectable, elegant, modernised, and occasional residence of a man of
      independent fortune, was considering Sir Thomas, with decided ill-will, as
      the destroyer of all this, and suffering the more from that involuntary
      forbearance which his character and manner commanded, and from not daring
      to relieve herself by a single attempt at throwing ridicule on his cause.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the agreeable of <i>her</i> speculation was over for that hour. It was
      time to have done with cards, if sermons prevailed; and she was glad to
      find it necessary to come to a conclusion, and be able to refresh her
      spirits by a change of place and neighbour.
    </p>
    <p>
      The chief of the party were now collected irregularly round the fire, and
      waiting the final break-up. William and Fanny were the most detached. They
      remained together at the otherwise deserted card-table, talking very
      comfortably, and not thinking of the rest, till some of the rest began to
      think of them. Henry Crawford&rsquo;s chair was the first to be given a
      direction towards them, and he sat silently observing them for a few
      minutes; himself, in the meanwhile, observed by Sir Thomas, who was
      standing in chat with Dr. Grant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is the assembly night,&rdquo; said William. &ldquo;If I were at Portsmouth I
      should be at it, perhaps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you do not wish yourself at Portsmouth, William?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Fanny, that I do not. I shall have enough of Portsmouth and of
      dancing too, when I cannot have you. And I do not know that there would be
      any good in going to the assembly, for I might not get a partner. The
      Portsmouth girls turn up their noses at anybody who has not a commission.
      One might as well be nothing as a midshipman. One <i>is</i> nothing,
      indeed. You remember the Gregorys; they are grown up amazing fine girls,
      but they will hardly speak to <i>me</i>, because Lucy is courted by a
      lieutenant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! shame, shame! But never mind it, William&rdquo; (her own cheeks in a glow
      of indignation as she spoke). &ldquo;It is not worth minding. It is no
      reflection on <i>you</i>; it is no more than what the greatest admirals
      have all experienced, more or less, in their time. You must think of that,
      you must try to make up your mind to it as one of the hardships which fall
      to every sailor&rsquo;s share, like bad weather and hard living, only with this
      advantage, that there will be an end to it, that there will come a time
      when you will have nothing of that sort to endure. When you are a
      lieutenant! only think, William, when you are a lieutenant, how little you
      will care for any nonsense of this kind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I begin to think I shall never be a lieutenant, Fanny. Everybody gets
      made but me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! my dear William, do not talk so; do not be so desponding. My uncle
      says nothing, but I am sure he will do everything in his power to get you
      made. He knows, as well as you do, of what consequence it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was checked by the sight of her uncle much nearer to them than she had
      any suspicion of, and each found it necessary to talk of something else.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you fond of dancing, Fanny?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, very; only I am soon tired.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like to go to a ball with you and see you dance. Have you never
      any balls at Northampton? I should like to see you dance, and I&rsquo;d dance
      with you if you <i>would</i>, for nobody would know who I was here, and I
      should like to be your partner once more. We used to jump about together
      many a time, did not we? when the hand-organ was in the street? I am a
      pretty good dancer in my way, but I dare say you are a better.&rdquo; And
      turning to his uncle, who was now close to them, &ldquo;Is not Fanny a very good
      dancer, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fanny, in dismay at such an unprecedented question, did not know which way
      to look, or how to be prepared for the answer. Some very grave reproof, or
      at least the coldest expression of indifference, must be coming to
      distress her brother, and sink her to the ground. But, on the contrary, it
      was no worse than, &ldquo;I am sorry to say that I am unable to answer your
      question. I have never seen Fanny dance since she was a little girl; but I
      trust we shall both think she acquits herself like a gentlewoman when we
      do see her, which, perhaps, we may have an opportunity of doing ere long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have had the pleasure of seeing your sister dance, Mr. Price,&rdquo; said
      Henry Crawford, leaning forward, &ldquo;and will engage to answer every inquiry
      which you can make on the subject, to your entire satisfaction. But I
      believe&rdquo; (seeing Fanny looked distressed) &ldquo;it must be at some other time.
      There is <i>one</i> person in company who does not like to have Miss Price
      spoken of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      True enough, he had once seen Fanny dance; and it was equally true that he
      would now have answered for her gliding about with quiet, light elegance,
      and in admirable time; but, in fact, he could not for the life of him
      recall what her dancing had been, and rather took it for granted that she
      had been present than remembered anything about her.
    </p>
    <p>
      He passed, however, for an admirer of her dancing; and Sir Thomas, by no
      means displeased, prolonged the conversation on dancing in general, and
      was so well engaged in describing the balls of Antigua, and listening to
      what his nephew could relate of the different modes of dancing which had
      fallen within his observation, that he had not heard his carriage
      announced, and was first called to the knowledge of it by the bustle of
      Mrs. Norris.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, Fanny, Fanny, what are you about? We are going. Do not you see your
      aunt is going? Quick, quick! I cannot bear to keep good old Wilcox
      waiting. You should always remember the coachman and horses. My dear Sir
      Thomas, we have settled it that the carriage should come back for you, and
      Edmund and William.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sir Thomas could not dissent, as it had been his own arrangement,
      previously communicated to his wife and sister; but <i>that</i> seemed
      forgotten by Mrs. Norris, who must fancy that she settled it all herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fanny&rsquo;s last feeling in the visit was disappointment: for the shawl which
      Edmund was quietly taking from the servant to bring and put round her
      shoulders was seized by Mr. Crawford&rsquo;s quicker hand, and she was obliged
      to be indebted to his more prominent attention.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVI
    </h2>
    <p>
      William&rsquo;s desire of seeing Fanny dance made more than a momentary
      impression on his uncle. The hope of an opportunity, which Sir Thomas had
      then given, was not given to be thought of no more. He remained steadily
      inclined to gratify so amiable a feeling; to gratify anybody else who
      might wish to see Fanny dance, and to give pleasure to the young people in
      general; and having thought the matter over, and taken his resolution in
      quiet independence, the result of it appeared the next morning at
      breakfast, when, after recalling and commending what his nephew had said,
      he added, &ldquo;I do not like, William, that you should leave Northamptonshire
      without this indulgence. It would give me pleasure to see you both dance.
      You spoke of the balls at Northampton. Your cousins have occasionally
      attended them; but they would not altogether suit us now. The fatigue
      would be too much for your aunt. I believe we must not think of a
      Northampton ball. A dance at home would be more eligible; and if&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, my dear Sir Thomas!&rdquo; interrupted Mrs. Norris, &ldquo;I knew what was
      coming. I knew what you were going to say. If dear Julia were at home, or
      dearest Mrs. Rushworth at Sotherton, to afford a reason, an occasion for
      such a thing, you would be tempted to give the young people a dance at
      Mansfield. I know you would. If <i>they</i> were at home to grace the
      ball, a ball you would have this very Christmas. Thank your uncle,
      William, thank your uncle!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My daughters,&rdquo; replied Sir Thomas, gravely interposing, &ldquo;have their
      pleasures at Brighton, and I hope are very happy; but the dance which I
      think of giving at Mansfield will be for their cousins. Could we be all
      assembled, our satisfaction would undoubtedly be more complete, but the
      absence of some is not to debar the others of amusement.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Norris had not another word to say. She saw decision in his looks,
      and her surprise and vexation required some minutes&rsquo; silence to be settled
      into composure. A ball at such a time! His daughters absent and herself
      not consulted! There was comfort, however, soon at hand. <i>She</i> must
      be the doer of everything: Lady Bertram would of course be spared all
      thought and exertion, and it would all fall upon <i>her</i>. She should
      have to do the honours of the evening; and this reflection quickly
      restored so much of her good-humour as enabled her to join in with the
      others, before their happiness and thanks were all expressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Edmund, William, and Fanny did, in their different ways, look and speak as
      much grateful pleasure in the promised ball as Sir Thomas could desire.
      Edmund&rsquo;s feelings were for the other two. His father had never conferred a
      favour or shewn a kindness more to his satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Bertram was perfectly quiescent and contented, and had no objections
      to make. Sir Thomas engaged for its giving her very little trouble; and
      she assured him &ldquo;that she was not at all afraid of the trouble; indeed,
      she could not imagine there would be any.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Norris was ready with her suggestions as to the rooms he would think
      fittest to be used, but found it all prearranged; and when she would have
      conjectured and hinted about the day, it appeared that the day was settled
      too. Sir Thomas had been amusing himself with shaping a very complete
      outline of the business; and as soon as she would listen quietly, could
      read his list of the families to be invited, from whom he calculated, with
      all necessary allowance for the shortness of the notice, to collect young
      people enough to form twelve or fourteen couple: and could detail the
      considerations which had induced him to fix on the 22nd as the most
      eligible day. William was required to be at Portsmouth on the 24th; the
      22nd would therefore be the last day of his visit; but where the days were
      so few it would be unwise to fix on any earlier. Mrs. Norris was obliged
      to be satisfied with thinking just the same, and with having been on the
      point of proposing the 22nd herself, as by far the best day for the
      purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ball was now a settled thing, and before the evening a proclaimed
      thing to all whom it concerned. Invitations were sent with despatch, and
      many a young lady went to bed that night with her head full of happy cares
      as well as Fanny. To her the cares were sometimes almost beyond the
      happiness; for young and inexperienced, with small means of choice and no
      confidence in her own taste, the &ldquo;how she should be dressed&rdquo; was a point
      of painful solicitude; and the almost solitary ornament in her possession,
      a very pretty amber cross which William had brought her from Sicily, was
      the greatest distress of all, for she had nothing but a bit of ribbon to
      fasten it to; and though she had worn it in that manner once, would it be
      allowable at such a time in the midst of all the rich ornaments which she
      supposed all the other young ladies would appear in? And yet not to wear
      it! William had wanted to buy her a gold chain too, but the purchase had
      been beyond his means, and therefore not to wear the cross might be
      mortifying him. These were anxious considerations; enough to sober her
      spirits even under the prospect of a ball given principally for her
      gratification.
    </p>
    <p>
      The preparations meanwhile went on, and Lady Bertram continued to sit on
      her sofa without any inconvenience from them. She had some extra visits
      from the housekeeper, and her maid was rather hurried in making up a new
      dress for her: Sir Thomas gave orders, and Mrs. Norris ran about; but all
      this gave <i>her</i> no trouble, and as she had foreseen, &ldquo;there was, in
      fact, no trouble in the business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Edmund was at this time particularly full of cares: his mind being deeply
      occupied in the consideration of two important events now at hand, which
      were to fix his fate in life&mdash;ordination and matrimony&mdash;events
      of such a serious character as to make the ball, which would be very
      quickly followed by one of them, appear of less moment in his eyes than in
      those of any other person in the house. On the 23rd he was going to a
      friend near Peterborough, in the same situation as himself, and they were
      to receive ordination in the course of the Christmas week. Half his
      destiny would then be determined, but the other half might not be so very
      smoothly wooed. His duties would be established, but the wife who was to
      share, and animate, and reward those duties, might yet be unattainable. He
      knew his own mind, but he was not always perfectly assured of knowing Miss
      Crawford&rsquo;s. There were points on which they did not quite agree; there
      were moments in which she did not seem propitious; and though trusting
      altogether to her affection, so far as to be resolved&mdash;almost
      resolved&mdash;on bringing it to a decision within a very short time, as
      soon as the variety of business before him were arranged, and he knew what
      he had to offer her, he had many anxious feelings, many doubting hours as
      to the result. His conviction of her regard for him was sometimes very
      strong; he could look back on a long course of encouragement, and she was
      as perfect in disinterested attachment as in everything else. But at other
      times doubt and alarm intermingled with his hopes; and when he thought of
      her acknowledged disinclination for privacy and retirement, her decided
      preference of a London life, what could he expect but a determined
      rejection? unless it were an acceptance even more to be deprecated,
      demanding such sacrifices of situation and employment on his side as
      conscience must forbid.
    </p>
    <p>
      The issue of all depended on one question. Did she love him well enough to
      forego what had used to be essential points? Did she love him well enough
      to make them no longer essential? And this question, which he was
      continually repeating to himself, though oftenest answered with a &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;
       had sometimes its &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Crawford was soon to leave Mansfield, and on this circumstance the
      &ldquo;no&rdquo; and the &ldquo;yes&rdquo; had been very recently in alternation. He had seen her
      eyes sparkle as she spoke of the dear friend&rsquo;s letter, which claimed a
      long visit from her in London, and of the kindness of Henry, in engaging
      to remain where he was till January, that he might convey her thither; he
      had heard her speak of the pleasure of such a journey with an animation
      which had &ldquo;no&rdquo; in every tone. But this had occurred on the first day of
      its being settled, within the first hour of the burst of such enjoyment,
      when nothing but the friends she was to visit was before her. He had since
      heard her express herself differently, with other feelings, more chequered
      feelings: he had heard her tell Mrs. Grant that she should leave her with
      regret; that she began to believe neither the friends nor the pleasures
      she was going to were worth those she left behind; and that though she
      felt she must go, and knew she should enjoy herself when once away, she
      was already looking forward to being at Mansfield again. Was there not a
      &ldquo;yes&rdquo; in all this?
    </p>
    <p>
      With such matters to ponder over, and arrange, and re-arrange, Edmund
      could not, on his own account, think very much of the evening which the
      rest of the family were looking forward to with a more equal degree of
      strong interest. Independent of his two cousins&rsquo; enjoyment in it, the
      evening was to him of no higher value than any other appointed meeting of
      the two families might be. In every meeting there was a hope of receiving
      farther confirmation of Miss Crawford&rsquo;s attachment; but the whirl of a
      ballroom, perhaps, was not particularly favourable to the excitement or
      expression of serious feelings. To engage her early for the two first
      dances was all the command of individual happiness which he felt in his
      power, and the only preparation for the ball which he could enter into, in
      spite of all that was passing around him on the subject, from morning till
      night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thursday was the day of the ball; and on Wednesday morning Fanny, still
      unable to satisfy herself as to what she ought to wear, determined to seek
      the counsel of the more enlightened, and apply to Mrs. Grant and her
      sister, whose acknowledged taste would certainly bear her blameless; and
      as Edmund and William were gone to Northampton, and she had reason to
      think Mr. Crawford likewise out, she walked down to the Parsonage without
      much fear of wanting an opportunity for private discussion; and the
      privacy of such a discussion was a most important part of it to Fanny,
      being more than half-ashamed of her own solicitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      She met Miss Crawford within a few yards of the Parsonage, just setting
      out to call on her, and as it seemed to her that her friend, though
      obliged to insist on turning back, was unwilling to lose her walk, she
      explained her business at once, and observed, that if she would be so kind
      as to give her opinion, it might be all talked over as well without doors
      as within. Miss Crawford appeared gratified by the application, and after
      a moment&rsquo;s thought, urged Fanny&rsquo;s returning with her in a much more
      cordial manner than before, and proposed their going up into her room,
      where they might have a comfortable coze, without disturbing Dr. and Mrs.
      Grant, who were together in the drawing-room. It was just the plan to suit
      Fanny; and with a great deal of gratitude on her side for such ready and
      kind attention, they proceeded indoors, and upstairs, and were soon deep
      in the interesting subject. Miss Crawford, pleased with the appeal, gave
      her all her best judgment and taste, made everything easy by her
      suggestions, and tried to make everything agreeable by her encouragement.
      The dress being settled in all its grander parts&mdash;&ldquo;But what shall you
      have by way of necklace?&rdquo; said Miss Crawford. &ldquo;Shall not you wear your
      brother&rsquo;s cross?&rdquo; And as she spoke she was undoing a small parcel, which
      Fanny had observed in her hand when they met. Fanny acknowledged her
      wishes and doubts on this point: she did not know how either to wear the
      cross, or to refrain from wearing it. She was answered by having a small
      trinket-box placed before her, and being requested to chuse from among
      several gold chains and necklaces. Such had been the parcel with which
      Miss Crawford was provided, and such the object of her intended visit: and
      in the kindest manner she now urged Fanny&rsquo;s taking one for the cross and
      to keep for her sake, saying everything she could think of to obviate the
      scruples which were making Fanny start back at first with a look of horror
      at the proposal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see what a collection I have,&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;more by half than I ever
      use or think of. I do not offer them as new. I offer nothing but an old
      necklace. You must forgive the liberty, and oblige me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fanny still resisted, and from her heart. The gift was too valuable. But
      Miss Crawford persevered, and argued the case with so much affectionate
      earnestness through all the heads of William and the cross, and the ball,
      and herself, as to be finally successful. Fanny found herself obliged to
      yield, that she might not be accused of pride or indifference, or some
      other littleness; and having with modest reluctance given her consent,
      proceeded to make the selection. She looked and looked, longing to know
      which might be least valuable; and was determined in her choice at last,
      by fancying there was one necklace more frequently placed before her eyes
      than the rest. It was of gold, prettily worked; and though Fanny would
      have preferred a longer and a plainer chain as more adapted for her
      purpose, she hoped, in fixing on this, to be chusing what Miss Crawford
      least wished to keep. Miss Crawford smiled her perfect approbation; and
      hastened to complete the gift by putting the necklace round her, and
      making her see how well it looked. Fanny had not a word to say against its
      becomingness, and, excepting what remained of her scruples, was
      exceedingly pleased with an acquisition so very apropos. She would rather,
      perhaps, have been obliged to some other person. But this was an unworthy
      feeling. Miss Crawford had anticipated her wants with a kindness which
      proved her a real friend. &ldquo;When I wear this necklace I shall always think
      of you,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;and feel how very kind you were.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must think of somebody else too, when you wear that necklace,&rdquo;
       replied Miss Crawford. &ldquo;You must think of Henry, for it was his choice in
      the first place. He gave it to me, and with the necklace I make over to
      you all the duty of remembering the original giver. It is to be a family
      remembrancer. The sister is not to be in your mind without bringing the
      brother too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fanny, in great astonishment and confusion, would have returned the
      present instantly. To take what had been the gift of another person, of a
      brother too, impossible! it must not be! and with an eagerness and
      embarrassment quite diverting to her companion, she laid down the necklace
      again on its cotton, and seemed resolved either to take another or none at
      all. Miss Crawford thought she had never seen a prettier consciousness.
      &ldquo;My dear child,&rdquo; said she, laughing, &ldquo;what are you afraid of? Do you think
      Henry will claim the necklace as mine, and fancy you did not come honestly
      by it? or are you imagining he would be too much flattered by seeing round
      your lovely throat an ornament which his money purchased three years ago,
      before he knew there was such a throat in the world? or perhaps&rdquo;&mdash;looking
      archly&mdash;&ldquo;you suspect a confederacy between us, and that what I am now
      doing is with his knowledge and at his desire?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With the deepest blushes Fanny protested against such a thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; replied Miss Crawford more seriously, but without at all
      believing her, &ldquo;to convince me that you suspect no trick, and are as
      unsuspicious of compliment as I have always found you, take the necklace
      and say no more about it. Its being a gift of my brother&rsquo;s need not make
      the smallest difference in your accepting it, as I assure you it makes
      none in my willingness to part with it. He is always giving me something
      or other. I have such innumerable presents from him that it is quite
      impossible for me to value or for him to remember half. And as for this
      necklace, I do not suppose I have worn it six times: it is very pretty,
      but I never think of it; and though you would be most heartily welcome to
      any other in my trinket-box, you have happened to fix on the very one
      which, if I have a choice, I would rather part with and see in your
      possession than any other. Say no more against it, I entreat you. Such a
      trifle is not worth half so many words.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fanny dared not make any farther opposition; and with renewed but less
      happy thanks accepted the necklace again, for there was an expression in
      Miss Crawford&rsquo;s eyes which she could not be satisfied with.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was impossible for her to be insensible of Mr. Crawford&rsquo;s change of
      manners. She had long seen it. He evidently tried to please her: he was
      gallant, he was attentive, he was something like what he had been to her
      cousins: he wanted, she supposed, to cheat her of her tranquillity as he
      had cheated them; and whether he might not have some concern in this
      necklace&mdash;she could not be convinced that he had not, for Miss
      Crawford, complaisant as a sister, was careless as a woman and a friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reflecting and doubting, and feeling that the possession of what she had
      so much wished for did not bring much satisfaction, she now walked home
      again, with a change rather than a diminution of cares since her treading
      that path before.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVII
    </h2>
    <p>
      On reaching home Fanny went immediately upstairs to deposit this
      unexpected acquisition, this doubtful good of a necklace, in some
      favourite box in the East room, which held all her smaller treasures; but
      on opening the door, what was her surprise to find her cousin Edmund there
      writing at the table! Such a sight having never occurred before, was
      almost as wonderful as it was welcome.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fanny,&rdquo; said he directly, leaving his seat and his pen, and meeting her
      with something in his hand, &ldquo;I beg your pardon for being here. I came to
      look for you, and after waiting a little while in hope of your coming in,
      was making use of your inkstand to explain my errand. You will find the
      beginning of a note to yourself; but I can now speak my business, which is
      merely to beg your acceptance of this little trifle&mdash;a chain for
      William&rsquo;s cross. You ought to have had it a week ago, but there has been a
      delay from my brother&rsquo;s not being in town by several days so soon as I
      expected; and I have only just now received it at Northampton. I hope you
      will like the chain itself, Fanny. I endeavoured to consult the simplicity
      of your taste; but, at any rate, I know you will be kind to my intentions,
      and consider it, as it really is, a token of the love of one of your
      oldest friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And so saying, he was hurrying away, before Fanny, overpowered by a
      thousand feelings of pain and pleasure, could attempt to speak; but
      quickened by one sovereign wish, she then called out, &ldquo;Oh! cousin, stop a
      moment, pray stop!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot attempt to thank you,&rdquo; she continued, in a very agitated manner;
      &ldquo;thanks are out of the question. I feel much more than I can possibly
      express. Your goodness in thinking of me in such a way is beyond&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If that is all you have to say, Fanny&rdquo; smiling and turning away again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, it is not. I want to consult you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Almost unconsciously she had now undone the parcel he had just put into
      her hand, and seeing before her, in all the niceness of jewellers&rsquo; 
      packing, a plain gold chain, perfectly simple and neat, she could not help
      bursting forth again, &ldquo;Oh, this is beautiful indeed! This is the very
      thing, precisely what I wished for! This is the only ornament I have ever
      had a desire to possess. It will exactly suit my cross. They must and
      shall be worn together. It comes, too, in such an acceptable moment. Oh,
      cousin, you do not know how acceptable it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Fanny, you feel these things a great deal too much. I am most
      happy that you like the chain, and that it should be here in time for
      to-morrow; but your thanks are far beyond the occasion. Believe me, I have
      no pleasure in the world superior to that of contributing to yours. No, I
      can safely say, I have no pleasure so complete, so unalloyed. It is
      without a drawback.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Upon such expressions of affection Fanny could have lived an hour without
      saying another word; but Edmund, after waiting a moment, obliged her to
      bring down her mind from its heavenly flight by saying, &ldquo;But what is it
      that you want to consult me about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was about the necklace, which she was now most earnestly longing to
      return, and hoped to obtain his approbation of her doing. She gave the
      history of her recent visit, and now her raptures might well be over; for
      Edmund was so struck with the circumstance, so delighted with what Miss
      Crawford had done, so gratified by such a coincidence of conduct between
      them, that Fanny could not but admit the superior power of one pleasure
      over his own mind, though it might have its drawback. It was some time
      before she could get his attention to her plan, or any answer to her
      demand of his opinion: he was in a reverie of fond reflection, uttering
      only now and then a few half-sentences of praise; but when he did awake
      and understand, he was very decided in opposing what she wished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Return the necklace! No, my dear Fanny, upon no account. It would be
      mortifying her severely. There can hardly be a more unpleasant sensation
      than the having anything returned on our hands which we have given with a
      reasonable hope of its contributing to the comfort of a friend. Why should
      she lose a pleasure which she has shewn herself so deserving of?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it had been given to me in the first instance,&rdquo; said Fanny, &ldquo;I should
      not have thought of returning it; but being her brother&rsquo;s present, is not
      it fair to suppose that she would rather not part with it, when it is not
      wanted?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She must not suppose it not wanted, not acceptable, at least: and its
      having been originally her brother&rsquo;s gift makes no difference; for as she
      was not prevented from offering, nor you from taking it on that account,
      it ought not to prevent you from keeping it. No doubt it is handsomer than
      mine, and fitter for a ballroom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it is not handsomer, not at all handsomer in its way, and, for my
      purpose, not half so fit. The chain will agree with William&rsquo;s cross beyond
      all comparison better than the necklace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For one night, Fanny, for only one night, if it <i>be</i> a sacrifice; I
      am sure you will, upon consideration, make that sacrifice rather than give
      pain to one who has been so studious of your comfort. Miss Crawford&rsquo;s
      attentions to you have been&mdash;not more than you were justly entitled
      to&mdash;I am the last person to think that <i>could</i> <i>be</i>, but
      they have been invariable; and to be returning them with what must have
      something the <i>air</i> of ingratitude, though I know it could never have
      the <i>meaning</i>, is not in your nature, I am sure. Wear the necklace,
      as you are engaged to do, to-morrow evening, and let the chain, which was
      not ordered with any reference to the ball, be kept for commoner
      occasions. This is my advice. I would not have the shadow of a coolness
      between the two whose intimacy I have been observing with the greatest
      pleasure, and in whose characters there is so much general resemblance in
      true generosity and natural delicacy as to make the few slight
      differences, resulting principally from situation, no reasonable hindrance
      to a perfect friendship. I would not have the shadow of a coolness arise,&rdquo;
       he repeated, his voice sinking a little, &ldquo;between the two dearest objects
      I have on earth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was gone as he spoke; and Fanny remained to tranquillise herself as she
      could. She was one of his two dearest&mdash;that must support her. But the
      other: the first! She had never heard him speak so openly before, and
      though it told her no more than what she had long perceived, it was a
      stab, for it told of his own convictions and views. They were decided. He
      would marry Miss Crawford. It was a stab, in spite of every long-standing
      expectation; and she was obliged to repeat again and again, that she was
      one of his two dearest, before the words gave her any sensation. Could she
      believe Miss Crawford to deserve him, it would be&mdash;oh, how different
      would it be&mdash;how far more tolerable! But he was deceived in her: he
      gave her merits which she had not; her faults were what they had ever
      been, but he saw them no longer. Till she had shed many tears over this
      deception, Fanny could not subdue her agitation; and the dejection which
      followed could only be relieved by the influence of fervent prayers for
      his happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was her intention, as she felt it to be her duty, to try to overcome
      all that was excessive, all that bordered on selfishness, in her affection
      for Edmund. To call or to fancy it a loss, a disappointment, would be a
      presumption for which she had not words strong enough to satisfy her own
      humility. To think of him as Miss Crawford might be justified in thinking,
      would in her be insanity. To her he could be nothing under any
      circumstances; nothing dearer than a friend. Why did such an idea occur to
      her even enough to be reprobated and forbidden? It ought not to have
      touched on the confines of her imagination. She would endeavour to be
      rational, and to deserve the right of judging of Miss Crawford&rsquo;s
      character, and the privilege of true solicitude for him by a sound
      intellect and an honest heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had all the heroism of principle, and was determined to do her duty;
      but having also many of the feelings of youth and nature, let her not be
      much wondered at, if, after making all these good resolutions on the side
      of self-government, she seized the scrap of paper on which Edmund had
      begun writing to her, as a treasure beyond all her hopes, and reading with
      the tenderest emotion these words, &ldquo;My very dear Fanny, you must do me the
      favour to accept&rdquo; locked it up with the chain, as the dearest part of the
      gift. It was the only thing approaching to a letter which she had ever
      received from him; she might never receive another; it was impossible that
      she ever should receive another so perfectly gratifying in the occasion
      and the style. Two lines more prized had never fallen from the pen of the
      most distinguished author&mdash;never more completely blessed the
      researches of the fondest biographer. The enthusiasm of a woman&rsquo;s love is
      even beyond the biographer&rsquo;s. To her, the handwriting itself, independent
      of anything it may convey, is a blessedness. Never were such characters
      cut by any other human being as Edmund&rsquo;s commonest handwriting gave! This
      specimen, written in haste as it was, had not a fault; and there was a
      felicity in the flow of the first four words, in the arrangement of &ldquo;My
      very dear Fanny,&rdquo; which she could have looked at for ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having regulated her thoughts and comforted her feelings by this happy
      mixture of reason and weakness, she was able in due time to go down and
      resume her usual employments near her aunt Bertram, and pay her the usual
      observances without any apparent want of spirits.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thursday, predestined to hope and enjoyment, came; and opened with more
      kindness to Fanny than such self-willed, unmanageable days often
      volunteer, for soon after breakfast a very friendly note was brought from
      Mr. Crawford to William, stating that as he found himself obliged to go to
      London on the morrow for a few days, he could not help trying to procure a
      companion; and therefore hoped that if William could make up his mind to
      leave Mansfield half a day earlier than had been proposed, he would accept
      a place in his carriage. Mr. Crawford meant to be in town by his uncle&rsquo;s
      accustomary late dinner-hour, and William was invited to dine with him at
      the Admiral&rsquo;s. The proposal was a very pleasant one to William himself,
      who enjoyed the idea of travelling post with four horses, and such a
      good-humoured, agreeable friend; and, in likening it to going up with
      despatches, was saying at once everything in favour of its happiness and
      dignity which his imagination could suggest; and Fanny, from a different
      motive, was exceedingly pleased; for the original plan was that William
      should go up by the mail from Northampton the following night, which would
      not have allowed him an hour&rsquo;s rest before he must have got into a
      Portsmouth coach; and though this offer of Mr. Crawford&rsquo;s would rob her of
      many hours of his company, she was too happy in having William spared from
      the fatigue of such a journey, to think of anything else. Sir Thomas
      approved of it for another reason. His nephew&rsquo;s introduction to Admiral
      Crawford might be of service. The Admiral, he believed, had interest. Upon
      the whole, it was a very joyous note. Fanny&rsquo;s spirits lived on it half the
      morning, deriving some accession of pleasure from its writer being himself
      to go away.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for the ball, so near at hand, she had too many agitations and fears to
      have half the enjoyment in anticipation which she ought to have had, or
      must have been supposed to have by the many young ladies looking forward
      to the same event in situations more at ease, but under circumstances of
      less novelty, less interest, less peculiar gratification, than would be
      attributed to her. Miss Price, known only by name to half the people
      invited, was now to make her first appearance, and must be regarded as the
      queen of the evening. Who could be happier than Miss Price? But Miss Price
      had not been brought up to the trade of <i>coming</i> <i>out</i>; and had
      she known in what light this ball was, in general, considered respecting
      her, it would very much have lessened her comfort by increasing the fears
      she already had of doing wrong and being looked at. To dance without much
      observation or any extraordinary fatigue, to have strength and partners
      for about half the evening, to dance a little with Edmund, and not a great
      deal with Mr. Crawford, to see William enjoy himself, and be able to keep
      away from her aunt Norris, was the height of her ambition, and seemed to
      comprehend her greatest possibility of happiness. As these were the best
      of her hopes, they could not always prevail; and in the course of a long
      morning, spent principally with her two aunts, she was often under the
      influence of much less sanguine views. William, determined to make this
      last day a day of thorough enjoyment, was out snipe-shooting; Edmund, she
      had too much reason to suppose, was at the Parsonage; and left alone to
      bear the worrying of Mrs. Norris, who was cross because the housekeeper
      would have her own way with the supper, and whom <i>she</i> could not
      avoid though the housekeeper might, Fanny was worn down at last to think
      everything an evil belonging to the ball, and when sent off with a parting
      worry to dress, moved as languidly towards her own room, and felt as
      incapable of happiness as if she had been allowed no share in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she walked slowly upstairs she thought of yesterday; it had been about
      the same hour that she had returned from the Parsonage, and found Edmund
      in the East room. &ldquo;Suppose I were to find him there again to-day!&rdquo; said
      she to herself, in a fond indulgence of fancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fanny,&rdquo; said a voice at that moment near her. Starting and looking up,
      she saw, across the lobby she had just reached, Edmund himself, standing
      at the head of a different staircase. He came towards her. &ldquo;You look tired
      and fagged, Fanny. You have been walking too far.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I have not been out at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you have had fatigues within doors, which are worse. You had better
      have gone out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fanny, not liking to complain, found it easiest to make no answer; and
      though he looked at her with his usual kindness, she believed he had soon
      ceased to think of her countenance. He did not appear in spirits:
      something unconnected with her was probably amiss. They proceeded upstairs
      together, their rooms being on the same floor above.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I come from Dr. Grant&rsquo;s,&rdquo; said Edmund presently. &ldquo;You may guess my errand
      there, Fanny.&rdquo; And he looked so conscious, that Fanny could think but of
      one errand, which turned her too sick for speech. &ldquo;I wished to engage Miss
      Crawford for the two first dances,&rdquo; was the explanation that followed, and
      brought Fanny to life again, enabling her, as she found she was expected
      to speak, to utter something like an inquiry as to the result.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;she is engaged to me; but&rdquo; (with a smile that did not
      sit easy) &ldquo;she says it is to be the last time that she ever will dance
      with me. She is not serious. I think, I hope, I am sure she is not
      serious; but I would rather not hear it. She never has danced with a
      clergyman, she says, and she never <i>will</i>. For my own sake, I could
      wish there had been no ball just at&mdash;I mean not this very week, this
      very day; to-morrow I leave home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fanny struggled for speech, and said, &ldquo;I am very sorry that anything has
      occurred to distress you. This ought to be a day of pleasure. My uncle
      meant it so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes, yes! and it will be a day of pleasure. It will all end right. I
      am only vexed for a moment. In fact, it is not that I consider the ball as
      ill-timed; what does it signify? But, Fanny,&rdquo; stopping her, by taking her
      hand, and speaking low and seriously, &ldquo;you know what all this means. You
      see how it is; and could tell me, perhaps better than I could tell you,
      how and why I am vexed. Let me talk to you a little. You are a kind, kind
      listener. I have been pained by her manner this morning, and cannot get
      the better of it. I know her disposition to be as sweet and faultless as
      your own, but the influence of her former companions makes her seem&mdash;gives
      to her conversation, to her professed opinions, sometimes a tinge of
      wrong. She does not <i>think</i> evil, but she speaks it, speaks it in
      playfulness; and though I know it to be playfulness, it grieves me to the
      soul.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The effect of education,&rdquo; said Fanny gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Edmund could not but agree to it. &ldquo;Yes, that uncle and aunt! They have
      injured the finest mind; for sometimes, Fanny, I own to you, it does
      appear more than manner: it appears as if the mind itself was tainted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fanny imagined this to be an appeal to her judgment, and therefore, after
      a moment&rsquo;s consideration, said, &ldquo;If you only want me as a listener,
      cousin, I will be as useful as I can; but I am not qualified for an
      adviser. Do not ask advice of <i>me</i>. I am not competent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right, Fanny, to protest against such an office, but you need not
      be afraid. It is a subject on which I should never ask advice; it is the
      sort of subject on which it had better never be asked; and few, I imagine,
      do ask it, but when they want to be influenced against their conscience. I
      only want to talk to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One thing more. Excuse the liberty; but take care <i>how</i> you talk to
      me. Do not tell me anything now, which hereafter you may be sorry for. The
      time may come&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The colour rushed into her cheeks as she spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dearest Fanny!&rdquo; cried Edmund, pressing her hand to his lips with almost
      as much warmth as if it had been Miss Crawford&rsquo;s, &ldquo;you are all considerate
      thought! But it is unnecessary here. The time will never come. No such
      time as you allude to will ever come. I begin to think it most improbable:
      the chances grow less and less; and even if it should, there will be
      nothing to be remembered by either you or me that we need be afraid of,
      for I can never be ashamed of my own scruples; and if they are removed, it
      must be by changes that will only raise her character the more by the
      recollection of the faults she once had. You are the only being upon earth
      to whom I should say what I have said; but you have always known my
      opinion of her; you can bear me witness, Fanny, that I have never been
      blinded. How many a time have we talked over her little errors! You need
      not fear me; I have almost given up every serious idea of her; but I must
      be a blockhead indeed, if, whatever befell me, I could think of your
      kindness and sympathy without the sincerest gratitude.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had said enough to shake the experience of eighteen. He had said enough
      to give Fanny some happier feelings than she had lately known, and with a
      brighter look, she answered, &ldquo;Yes, cousin, I am convinced that <i>you</i>
      would be incapable of anything else, though perhaps some might not. I
      cannot be afraid of hearing anything you wish to say. Do not check
      yourself. Tell me whatever you like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were now on the second floor, and the appearance of a housemaid
      prevented any farther conversation. For Fanny&rsquo;s present comfort it was
      concluded, perhaps, at the happiest moment: had he been able to talk
      another five minutes, there is no saying that he might not have talked
      away all Miss Crawford&rsquo;s faults and his own despondence. But as it was,
      they parted with looks on his side of grateful affection, and with some
      very precious sensations on hers. She had felt nothing like it for hours.
      Since the first joy from Mr. Crawford&rsquo;s note to William had worn away, she
      had been in a state absolutely the reverse; there had been no comfort
      around, no hope within her. Now everything was smiling. William&rsquo;s good
      fortune returned again upon her mind, and seemed of greater value than at
      first. The ball, too&mdash;such an evening of pleasure before her! It was
      now a real animation; and she began to dress for it with much of the happy
      flutter which belongs to a ball. All went well: she did not dislike her
      own looks; and when she came to the necklaces again, her good fortune
      seemed complete, for upon trial the one given her by Miss Crawford would
      by no means go through the ring of the cross. She had, to oblige Edmund,
      resolved to wear it; but it was too large for the purpose. His, therefore,
      must be worn; and having, with delightful feelings, joined the chain and
      the cross&mdash;those memorials of the two most beloved of her heart,
      those dearest tokens so formed for each other by everything real and
      imaginary&mdash;and put them round her neck, and seen and felt how full of
      William and Edmund they were, she was able, without an effort, to resolve
      on wearing Miss Crawford&rsquo;s necklace too. She acknowledged it to be right.
      Miss Crawford had a claim; and when it was no longer to encroach on, to
      interfere with the stronger claims, the truer kindness of another, she
      could do her justice even with pleasure to herself. The necklace really
      looked very well; and Fanny left her room at last, comfortably satisfied
      with herself and all about her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her aunt Bertram had recollected her on this occasion with an unusual
      degree of wakefulness. It had really occurred to her, unprompted, that
      Fanny, preparing for a ball, might be glad of better help than the upper
      housemaid&rsquo;s, and when dressed herself, she actually sent her own maid to
      assist her; too late, of course, to be of any use. Mrs. Chapman had just
      reached the attic floor, when Miss Price came out of her room completely
      dressed, and only civilities were necessary; but Fanny felt her aunt&rsquo;s
      attention almost as much as Lady Bertram or Mrs. Chapman could do
      themselves.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Her uncle and both her aunts were in the drawing-room when Fanny went
      down. To the former she was an interesting object, and he saw with
      pleasure the general elegance of her appearance, and her being in
      remarkably good looks. The neatness and propriety of her dress was all
      that he would allow himself to commend in her presence, but upon her
      leaving the room again soon afterwards, he spoke of her beauty with very
      decided praise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Lady Bertram, &ldquo;she looks very well. I sent Chapman to her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look well! Oh, yes!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Norris, &ldquo;she has good reason to look well
      with all her advantages: brought up in this family as she has been, with
      all the benefit of her cousins&rsquo; manners before her. Only think, my dear
      Sir Thomas, what extraordinary advantages you and I have been the means of
      giving her. The very gown you have been taking notice of is your own
      generous present to her when dear Mrs. Rushworth married. What would she
      have been if we had not taken her by the hand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sir Thomas said no more; but when they sat down to table the eyes of the
      two young men assured him that the subject might be gently touched again,
      when the ladies withdrew, with more success. Fanny saw that she was
      approved; and the consciousness of looking well made her look still
      better. From a variety of causes she was happy, and she was soon made
      still happier; for in following her aunts out of the room, Edmund, who was
      holding open the door, said, as she passed him, &ldquo;You must dance with me,
      Fanny; you must keep two dances for me; any two that you like, except the
      first.&rdquo; She had nothing more to wish for. She had hardly ever been in a
      state so nearly approaching high spirits in her life. Her cousins&rsquo; former
      gaiety on the day of a ball was no longer surprising to her; she felt it
      to be indeed very charming, and was actually practising her steps about
      the drawing-room as long as she could be safe from the notice of her aunt
      Norris, who was entirely taken up at first in fresh arranging and injuring
      the noble fire which the butler had prepared.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half an hour followed that would have been at least languid under any
      other circumstances, but Fanny&rsquo;s happiness still prevailed. It was but to
      think of her conversation with Edmund, and what was the restlessness of
      Mrs. Norris? What were the yawns of Lady Bertram?
    </p>
    <p>
      The gentlemen joined them; and soon after began the sweet expectation of a
      carriage, when a general spirit of ease and enjoyment seemed diffused, and
      they all stood about and talked and laughed, and every moment had its
      pleasure and its hope. Fanny felt that there must be a struggle in
      Edmund&rsquo;s cheerfulness, but it was delightful to see the effort so
      successfully made.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the carriages were really heard, when the guests began really to
      assemble, her own gaiety of heart was much subdued: the sight of so many
      strangers threw her back into herself; and besides the gravity and
      formality of the first great circle, which the manners of neither Sir
      Thomas nor Lady Bertram were of a kind to do away, she found herself
      occasionally called on to endure something worse. She was introduced here
      and there by her uncle, and forced to be spoken to, and to curtsey, and
      speak again. This was a hard duty, and she was never summoned to it
      without looking at William, as he walked about at his ease in the
      background of the scene, and longing to be with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The entrance of the Grants and Crawfords was a favourable epoch. The
      stiffness of the meeting soon gave way before their popular manners and
      more diffused intimacies: little groups were formed, and everybody grew
      comfortable. Fanny felt the advantage; and, drawing back from the toils of
      civility, would have been again most happy, could she have kept her eyes
      from wandering between Edmund and Mary Crawford. <i>She</i> looked all
      loveliness&mdash;and what might not be the end of it? Her own musings were
      brought to an end on perceiving Mr. Crawford before her, and her thoughts
      were put into another channel by his engaging her almost instantly for the
      first two dances. Her happiness on this occasion was very much <i>a</i> <i>la</i>
      <i>mortal</i>, finely chequered. To be secure of a partner at first was a
      most essential good&mdash;for the moment of beginning was now growing
      seriously near; and she so little understood her own claims as to think
      that if Mr. Crawford had not asked her, she must have been the last to be
      sought after, and should have received a partner only through a series of
      inquiry, and bustle, and interference, which would have been terrible; but
      at the same time there was a pointedness in his manner of asking her which
      she did not like, and she saw his eye glancing for a moment at her
      necklace, with a smile&mdash;she thought there was a smile&mdash;which
      made her blush and feel wretched. And though there was no second glance to
      disturb her, though his object seemed then to be only quietly agreeable,
      she could not get the better of her embarrassment, heightened as it was by
      the idea of his perceiving it, and had no composure till he turned away to
      some one else. Then she could gradually rise up to the genuine
      satisfaction of having a partner, a voluntary partner, secured against the
      dancing began.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the company were moving into the ballroom, she found herself for the
      first time near Miss Crawford, whose eyes and smiles were immediately and
      more unequivocally directed as her brother&rsquo;s had been, and who was
      beginning to speak on the subject, when Fanny, anxious to get the story
      over, hastened to give the explanation of the second necklace: the real
      chain. Miss Crawford listened; and all her intended compliments and
      insinuations to Fanny were forgotten: she felt only one thing; and her
      eyes, bright as they had been before, shewing they could yet be brighter,
      she exclaimed with eager pleasure, &ldquo;Did he? Did Edmund? That was like
      himself. No other man would have thought of it. I honour him beyond
      expression.&rdquo; And she looked around as if longing to tell him so. He was
      not near, he was attending a party of ladies out of the room; and Mrs.
      Grant coming up to the two girls, and taking an arm of each, they followed
      with the rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fanny&rsquo;s heart sunk, but there was no leisure for thinking long even of
      Miss Crawford&rsquo;s feelings. They were in the ballroom, the violins were
      playing, and her mind was in a flutter that forbade its fixing on anything
      serious. She must watch the general arrangements, and see how everything
      was done.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a few minutes Sir Thomas came to her, and asked if she were engaged;
      and the &ldquo;Yes, sir; to Mr. Crawford,&rdquo; was exactly what he had intended to
      hear. Mr. Crawford was not far off; Sir Thomas brought him to her, saying
      something which discovered to Fanny, that <i>she</i> was to lead the way
      and open the ball; an idea that had never occurred to her before. Whenever
      she had thought of the minutiae of the evening, it had been as a matter of
      course that Edmund would begin with Miss Crawford; and the impression was
      so strong, that though <i>her</i> <i>uncle</i> spoke the contrary, she
      could not help an exclamation of surprise, a hint of her unfitness, an
      entreaty even to be excused. To be urging her opinion against Sir Thomas&rsquo;s
      was a proof of the extremity of the case; but such was her horror at the
      first suggestion, that she could actually look him in the face and say
      that she hoped it might be settled otherwise; in vain, however: Sir Thomas
      smiled, tried to encourage her, and then looked too serious, and said too
      decidedly, &ldquo;It must be so, my dear,&rdquo; for her to hazard another word; and
      she found herself the next moment conducted by Mr. Crawford to the top of
      the room, and standing there to be joined by the rest of the dancers,
      couple after couple, as they were formed.
    </p>
    <p>
      She could hardly believe it. To be placed above so many elegant young
      women! The distinction was too great. It was treating her like her
      cousins! And her thoughts flew to those absent cousins with most unfeigned
      and truly tender regret, that they were not at home to take their own
      place in the room, and have their share of a pleasure which would have
      been so very delightful to them. So often as she had heard them wish for a
      ball at home as the greatest of all felicities! And to have them away when
      it was given&mdash;and for <i>her</i> to be opening the ball&mdash;and
      with Mr. Crawford too! She hoped they would not envy her that distinction
      <i>now</i>; but when she looked back to the state of things in the autumn,
      to what they had all been to each other when once dancing in that house
      before, the present arrangement was almost more than she could understand
      herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ball began. It was rather honour than happiness to Fanny, for the
      first dance at least: her partner was in excellent spirits, and tried to
      impart them to her; but she was a great deal too much frightened to have
      any enjoyment till she could suppose herself no longer looked at. Young,
      pretty, and gentle, however, she had no awkwardnesses that were not as
      good as graces, and there were few persons present that were not disposed
      to praise her. She was attractive, she was modest, she was Sir Thomas&rsquo;s
      niece, and she was soon said to be admired by Mr. Crawford. It was enough
      to give her general favour. Sir Thomas himself was watching her progress
      down the dance with much complacency; he was proud of his niece; and
      without attributing all her personal beauty, as Mrs. Norris seemed to do,
      to her transplantation to Mansfield, he was pleased with himself for
      having supplied everything else: education and manners she owed to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Crawford saw much of Sir Thomas&rsquo;s thoughts as he stood, and having,
      in spite of all his wrongs towards her, a general prevailing desire of
      recommending herself to him, took an opportunity of stepping aside to say
      something agreeable of Fanny. Her praise was warm, and he received it as
      she could wish, joining in it as far as discretion, and politeness, and
      slowness of speech would allow, and certainly appearing to greater
      advantage on the subject than his lady did soon afterwards, when Mary,
      perceiving her on a sofa very near, turned round before she began to
      dance, to compliment her on Miss Price&rsquo;s looks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, she does look very well,&rdquo; was Lady Bertram&rsquo;s placid reply. &ldquo;Chapman
      helped her to dress. I sent Chapman to her.&rdquo; Not but that she was really
      pleased to have Fanny admired; but she was so much more struck with her
      own kindness in sending Chapman to her, that she could not get it out of
      her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Crawford knew Mrs. Norris too well to think of gratifying <i>her</i>
      by commendation of Fanny; to her, it was as the occasion offered&mdash;&ldquo;Ah!
      ma&rsquo;am, how much we want dear Mrs. Rushworth and Julia to-night!&rdquo; and Mrs.
      Norris paid her with as many smiles and courteous words as she had time
      for, amid so much occupation as she found for herself in making up
      card-tables, giving hints to Sir Thomas, and trying to move all the
      chaperons to a better part of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Crawford blundered most towards Fanny herself in her intentions to
      please. She meant to be giving her little heart a happy flutter, and
      filling her with sensations of delightful self-consequence; and,
      misinterpreting Fanny&rsquo;s blushes, still thought she must be doing so when
      she went to her after the two first dances, and said, with a significant
      look, &ldquo;Perhaps <i>you</i> can tell me why my brother goes to town
      to-morrow? He says he has business there, but will not tell me what. The
      first time he ever denied me his confidence! But this is what we all come
      to. All are supplanted sooner or later. Now, I must apply to you for
      information. Pray, what is Henry going for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fanny protested her ignorance as steadily as her embarrassment allowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; replied Miss Crawford, laughing, &ldquo;I must suppose it to be
      purely for the pleasure of conveying your brother, and of talking of you
      by the way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fanny was confused, but it was the confusion of discontent; while Miss
      Crawford wondered she did not smile, and thought her over-anxious, or
      thought her odd, or thought her anything rather than insensible of
      pleasure in Henry&rsquo;s attentions. Fanny had a good deal of enjoyment in the
      course of the evening; but Henry&rsquo;s attentions had very little to do with
      it. She would much rather <i>not</i> have been asked by him again so very
      soon, and she wished she had not been obliged to suspect that his previous
      inquiries of Mrs. Norris, about the supper hour, were all for the sake of
      securing her at that part of the evening. But it was not to be avoided: he
      made her feel that she was the object of all; though she could not say
      that it was unpleasantly done, that there was indelicacy or ostentation in
      his manner; and sometimes, when he talked of William, he was really not
      unagreeable, and shewed even a warmth of heart which did him credit. But
      still his attentions made no part of her satisfaction. She was happy
      whenever she looked at William, and saw how perfectly he was enjoying
      himself, in every five minutes that she could walk about with him and hear
      his account of his partners; she was happy in knowing herself admired; and
      she was happy in having the two dances with Edmund still to look forward
      to, during the greatest part of the evening, her hand being so eagerly
      sought after that her indefinite engagement with <i>him</i> was in
      continual perspective. She was happy even when they did take place; but
      not from any flow of spirits on his side, or any such expressions of
      tender gallantry as had blessed the morning. His mind was fagged, and her
      happiness sprung from being the friend with whom it could find repose. &ldquo;I
      am worn out with civility,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I have been talking incessantly all
      night, and with nothing to say. But with <i>you</i>, Fanny, there may be
      peace. You will not want to be talked to. Let us have the luxury of
      silence.&rdquo; Fanny would hardly even speak her agreement. A weariness,
      arising probably, in great measure, from the same feelings which he had
      acknowledged in the morning, was peculiarly to be respected, and they went
      down their two dances together with such sober tranquillity as might
      satisfy any looker-on that Sir Thomas had been bringing up no wife for his
      younger son.
    </p>
    <p>
      The evening had afforded Edmund little pleasure. Miss Crawford had been in
      gay spirits when they first danced together, but it was not her gaiety
      that could do him good: it rather sank than raised his comfort; and
      afterwards, for he found himself still impelled to seek her again, she had
      absolutely pained him by her manner of speaking of the profession to which
      he was now on the point of belonging. They had talked, and they had been
      silent; he had reasoned, she had ridiculed; and they had parted at last
      with mutual vexation. Fanny, not able to refrain entirely from observing
      them, had seen enough to be tolerably satisfied. It was barbarous to be
      happy when Edmund was suffering. Yet some happiness must and would arise
      from the very conviction that he did suffer.
    </p>
    <p>
      When her two dances with him were over, her inclination and strength for
      more were pretty well at an end; and Sir Thomas, having seen her walk
      rather than dance down the shortening set, breathless, and with her hand
      at her side, gave his orders for her sitting down entirely. From that time
      Mr. Crawford sat down likewise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Fanny!&rdquo; cried William, coming for a moment to visit her, and working
      away his partner&rsquo;s fan as if for life, &ldquo;how soon she is knocked up! Why,
      the sport is but just begun. I hope we shall keep it up these two hours.
      How can you be tired so soon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So soon! my good friend,&rdquo; said Sir Thomas, producing his watch with all
      necessary caution; &ldquo;it is three o&rsquo;clock, and your sister is not used to
      these sort of hours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, Fanny, you shall not get up to-morrow before I go. Sleep as
      long as you can, and never mind me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! William.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! Did she think of being up before you set off?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! yes, sir,&rdquo; cried Fanny, rising eagerly from her seat to be nearer her
      uncle; &ldquo;I must get up and breakfast with him. It will be the last time,
      you know; the last morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had better not. He is to have breakfasted and be gone by half-past
      nine. Mr. Crawford, I think you call for him at half-past nine?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fanny was too urgent, however, and had too many tears in her eyes for
      denial; and it ended in a gracious &ldquo;Well, well!&rdquo; which was permission.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, half-past nine,&rdquo; said Crawford to William as the latter was leaving
      them, &ldquo;and I shall be punctual, for there will be no kind sister to get up
      for <i>me</i>.&rdquo; And in a lower tone to Fanny, &ldquo;I shall have only a
      desolate house to hurry from. Your brother will find my ideas of time and
      his own very different to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After a short consideration, Sir Thomas asked Crawford to join the early
      breakfast party in that house instead of eating alone: he should himself
      be of it; and the readiness with which his invitation was accepted
      convinced him that the suspicions whence, he must confess to himself, this
      very ball had in great measure sprung, were well founded. Mr. Crawford was
      in love with Fanny. He had a pleasing anticipation of what would be. His
      niece, meanwhile, did not thank him for what he had just done. She had
      hoped to have William all to herself the last morning. It would have been
      an unspeakable indulgence. But though her wishes were overthrown, there
      was no spirit of murmuring within her. On the contrary, she was so totally
      unused to have her pleasure consulted, or to have anything take place at
      all in the way she could desire, that she was more disposed to wonder and
      rejoice in having carried her point so far, than to repine at the
      counteraction which followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shortly afterward, Sir Thomas was again interfering a little with her
      inclination, by advising her to go immediately to bed. &ldquo;Advise&rdquo; was his
      word, but it was the advice of absolute power, and she had only to rise,
      and, with Mr. Crawford&rsquo;s very cordial adieus, pass quietly away; stopping
      at the entrance-door, like the Lady of Branxholm Hall, &ldquo;one moment and no
      more,&rdquo; to view the happy scene, and take a last look at the five or six
      determined couple who were still hard at work; and then, creeping slowly
      up the principal staircase, pursued by the ceaseless country-dance,
      feverish with hopes and fears, soup and negus, sore-footed and fatigued,
      restless and agitated, yet feeling, in spite of everything, that a ball
      was indeed delightful.
    </p>
    <p>
      In thus sending her away, Sir Thomas perhaps might not be thinking merely
      of her health. It might occur to him that Mr. Crawford had been sitting by
      her long enough, or he might mean to recommend her as a wife by shewing
      her persuadableness.

      CHAPTER XXIX
    </h2>
    <p>
      The ball was over, and the breakfast was soon over too; the last kiss was
      given, and William was gone. Mr. Crawford had, as he foretold, been very
      punctual, and short and pleasant had been the meal.
    </p>
    <p>
      After seeing William to the last moment, Fanny walked back to the
      breakfast-room with a very saddened heart to grieve over the melancholy
      change; and there her uncle kindly left her to cry in peace, conceiving,
      perhaps, that the deserted chair of each young man might exercise her
      tender enthusiasm, and that the remaining cold pork bones and mustard in
      William&rsquo;s plate might but divide her feelings with the broken egg-shells
      in Mr. Crawford&rsquo;s. She sat and cried <i>con</i> <i>amore</i> as her uncle
      intended, but it was <i>con</i> <i>amore</i> fraternal and no other.
      William was gone, and she now felt as if she had wasted half his visit in
      idle cares and selfish solicitudes unconnected with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fanny&rsquo;s disposition was such that she could never even think of her aunt
      Norris in the meagreness and cheerlessness of her own small house, without
      reproaching herself for some little want of attention to her when they had
      been last together; much less could her feelings acquit her of having done
      and said and thought everything by William that was due to him for a whole
      fortnight.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a heavy, melancholy day. Soon after the second breakfast, Edmund
      bade them good-bye for a week, and mounted his horse for Peterborough, and
      then all were gone. Nothing remained of last night but remembrances, which
      she had nobody to share in. She talked to her aunt Bertram&mdash;she must
      talk to somebody of the ball; but her aunt had seen so little of what had
      passed, and had so little curiosity, that it was heavy work. Lady Bertram
      was not certain of anybody&rsquo;s dress or anybody&rsquo;s place at supper but her
      own. &ldquo;She could not recollect what it was that she had heard about one of
      the Miss Maddoxes, or what it was that Lady Prescott had noticed in Fanny:
      she was not sure whether Colonel Harrison had been talking of Mr. Crawford
      or of William when he said he was the finest young man in the room&mdash;somebody
      had whispered something to her; she had forgot to ask Sir Thomas what it
      could be.&rdquo; And these were her longest speeches and clearest
      communications: the rest was only a languid &ldquo;Yes, yes; very well; did you?
      did he? I did not see <i>that</i>; I should not know one from the other.&rdquo;
       This was very bad. It was only better than Mrs. Norris&rsquo;s sharp answers
      would have been; but she being gone home with all the supernumerary
      jellies to nurse a sick maid, there was peace and good-humour in their
      little party, though it could not boast much beside.
    </p>
    <p>
      The evening was heavy like the day. &ldquo;I cannot think what is the matter
      with me,&rdquo; said Lady Bertram, when the tea-things were removed. &ldquo;I feel
      quite stupid. It must be sitting up so late last night. Fanny, you must do
      something to keep me awake. I cannot work. Fetch the cards; I feel so very
      stupid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The cards were brought, and Fanny played at cribbage with her aunt till
      bedtime; and as Sir Thomas was reading to himself, no sounds were heard in
      the room for the next two hours beyond the reckonings of the game&mdash;&ldquo;And
      <i>that</i> makes thirty-one; four in hand and eight in crib. You are to
      deal, ma&rsquo;am; shall I deal for you?&rdquo; Fanny thought and thought again of the
      difference which twenty-four hours had made in that room, and all that
      part of the house. Last night it had been hope and smiles, bustle and
      motion, noise and brilliancy, in the drawing-room, and out of the
      drawing-room, and everywhere. Now it was languor, and all but solitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      A good night&rsquo;s rest improved her spirits. She could think of William the
      next day more cheerfully; and as the morning afforded her an opportunity
      of talking over Thursday night with Mrs. Grant and Miss Crawford, in a
      very handsome style, with all the heightenings of imagination, and all the
      laughs of playfulness which are so essential to the shade of a departed
      ball, she could afterwards bring her mind without much effort into its
      everyday state, and easily conform to the tranquillity of the present
      quiet week.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were indeed a smaller party than she had ever known there for a whole
      day together, and <i>he</i> was gone on whom the comfort and cheerfulness
      of every family meeting and every meal chiefly depended. But this must be
      learned to be endured. He would soon be always gone; and she was thankful
      that she could now sit in the same room with her uncle, hear his voice,
      receive his questions, and even answer them, without such wretched
      feelings as she had formerly known.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We miss our two young men,&rdquo; was Sir Thomas&rsquo;s observation on both the
      first and second day, as they formed their very reduced circle after
      dinner; and in consideration of Fanny&rsquo;s swimming eyes, nothing more was
      said on the first day than to drink their good health; but on the second
      it led to something farther. William was kindly commended and his
      promotion hoped for. &ldquo;And there is no reason to suppose,&rdquo; added Sir
      Thomas, &ldquo;but that his visits to us may now be tolerably frequent. As to
      Edmund, we must learn to do without him. This will be the last winter of
      his belonging to us, as he has done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Lady Bertram, &ldquo;but I wish he was not going away. They are all
      going away, I think. I wish they would stay at home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This wish was levelled principally at Julia, who had just applied for
      permission to go to town with Maria; and as Sir Thomas thought it best for
      each daughter that the permission should be granted, Lady Bertram, though
      in her own good-nature she would not have prevented it, was lamenting the
      change it made in the prospect of Julia&rsquo;s return, which would otherwise
      have taken place about this time. A great deal of good sense followed on
      Sir Thomas&rsquo;s side, tending to reconcile his wife to the arrangement.
      Everything that a considerate parent <i>ought</i> to feel was advanced for
      her use; and everything that an affectionate mother <i>must</i> feel in
      promoting her children&rsquo;s enjoyment was attributed to her nature. Lady
      Bertram agreed to it all with a calm &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;; and at the end of a quarter of
      an hour&rsquo;s silent consideration spontaneously observed, &ldquo;Sir Thomas, I have
      been thinking&mdash;and I am very glad we took Fanny as we did, for now
      the others are away we feel the good of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sir Thomas immediately improved this compliment by adding, &ldquo;Very true. We
      shew Fanny what a good girl we think her by praising her to her face, she
      is now a very valuable companion. If we have been kind to <i>her</i>, she
      is now quite as necessary to <i>us</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Lady Bertram presently; &ldquo;and it is a comfort to think that we
      shall always have <i>her</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sir Thomas paused, half smiled, glanced at his niece, and then gravely
      replied, &ldquo;She will never leave us, I hope, till invited to some other home
      that may reasonably promise her greater happiness than she knows here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And <i>that</i> is not very likely to be, Sir Thomas. Who should invite
      her? Maria might be very glad to see her at Sotherton now and then, but
      she would not think of asking her to live there; and I am sure she is
      better off here; and besides, I cannot do without her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The week which passed so quietly and peaceably at the great house in
      Mansfield had a very different character at the Parsonage. To the young
      lady, at least, in each family, it brought very different feelings. What
      was tranquillity and comfort to Fanny was tediousness and vexation to
      Mary. Something arose from difference of disposition and habit: one so
      easily satisfied, the other so unused to endure; but still more might be
      imputed to difference of circumstances. In some points of interest they
      were exactly opposed to each other. To Fanny&rsquo;s mind, Edmund&rsquo;s absence was
      really, in its cause and its tendency, a relief. To Mary it was every way
      painful. She felt the want of his society every day, almost every hour,
      and was too much in want of it to derive anything but irritation from
      considering the object for which he went. He could not have devised
      anything more likely to raise his consequence than this week&rsquo;s absence,
      occurring as it did at the very time of her brother&rsquo;s going away, of
      William Price&rsquo;s going too, and completing the sort of general break-up of
      a party which had been so animated. She felt it keenly. They were now a
      miserable trio, confined within doors by a series of rain and snow, with
      nothing to do and no variety to hope for. Angry as she was with Edmund for
      adhering to his own notions, and acting on them in defiance of her (and
      she had been so angry that they had hardly parted friends at the ball),
      she could not help thinking of him continually when absent, dwelling on
      his merit and affection, and longing again for the almost daily meetings
      they lately had. His absence was unnecessarily long. He should not have
      planned such an absence&mdash;he should not have left home for a week,
      when her own departure from Mansfield was so near. Then she began to blame
      herself. She wished she had not spoken so warmly in their last
      conversation. She was afraid she had used some strong, some contemptuous
      expressions in speaking of the clergy, and that should not have been. It
      was ill-bred; it was wrong. She wished such words unsaid with all her
      heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her vexation did not end with the week. All this was bad, but she had
      still more to feel when Friday came round again and brought no Edmund;
      when Saturday came and still no Edmund; and when, through the slight
      communication with the other family which Sunday produced, she learned
      that he had actually written home to defer his return, having promised to
      remain some days longer with his friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      If she had felt impatience and regret before&mdash;if she had been sorry
      for what she said, and feared its too strong effect on him&mdash;she now
      felt and feared it all tenfold more. She had, moreover, to contend with
      one disagreeable emotion entirely new to her&mdash;jealousy. His friend
      Mr. Owen had sisters; he might find them attractive. But, at any rate, his
      staying away at a time when, according to all preceding plans, she was to
      remove to London, meant something that she could not bear. Had Henry
      returned, as he talked of doing, at the end of three or four days, she
      should now have been leaving Mansfield. It became absolutely necessary for
      her to get to Fanny and try to learn something more. She could not live
      any longer in such solitary wretchedness; and she made her way to the
      Park, through difficulties of walking which she had deemed unconquerable a
      week before, for the chance of hearing a little in addition, for the sake
      of at least hearing his name.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first half-hour was lost, for Fanny and Lady Bertram were together,
      and unless she had Fanny to herself she could hope for nothing. But at
      last Lady Bertram left the room, and then almost immediately Miss Crawford
      thus began, with a voice as well regulated as she could&mdash;&ldquo;And how do
      <i>you</i> like your cousin Edmund&rsquo;s staying away so long? Being the only
      young person at home, I consider <i>you</i> as the greatest sufferer. You
      must miss him. Does his staying longer surprise you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not know,&rdquo; said Fanny hesitatingly. &ldquo;Yes; I had not particularly
      expected it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps he will always stay longer than he talks of. It is the general
      way all young men do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He did not, the only time he went to see Mr. Owen before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He finds the house more agreeable <i>now</i>. He is a very&mdash;a very
      pleasing young man himself, and I cannot help being rather concerned at
      not seeing him again before I go to London, as will now undoubtedly be the
      case. I am looking for Henry every day, and as soon as he comes there will
      be nothing to detain me at Mansfield. I should like to have seen him once
      more, I confess. But you must give my compliments to him. Yes; I think it
      must be compliments. Is not there a something wanted, Miss Price, in our
      language&mdash;a something between compliments and&mdash;and love&mdash;to
      suit the sort of friendly acquaintance we have had together? So many
      months&rsquo; acquaintance! But compliments may be sufficient here. Was his
      letter a long one? Does he give you much account of what he is doing? Is
      it Christmas gaieties that he is staying for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I only heard a part of the letter; it was to my uncle; but I believe it
      was very short; indeed I am sure it was but a few lines. All that I heard
      was that his friend had pressed him to stay longer, and that he had agreed
      to do so. A <i>few</i> days longer, or <i>some</i> days longer; I am not
      quite sure which.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! if he wrote to his father; but I thought it might have been to Lady
      Bertram or you. But if he wrote to his father, no wonder he was concise.
      Who could write chat to Sir Thomas? If he had written to you, there would
      have been more particulars. You would have heard of balls and parties. He
      would have sent you a description of everything and everybody. How many
      Miss Owens are there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three grown up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are they musical?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not at all know. I never heard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is the first question, you know,&rdquo; said Miss Crawford, trying to
      appear gay and unconcerned, &ldquo;which every woman who plays herself is sure
      to ask about another. But it is very foolish to ask questions about any
      young ladies&mdash;about any three sisters just grown up; for one knows,
      without being told, exactly what they are: all very accomplished and
      pleasing, and one very pretty. There is a beauty in every family; it is a
      regular thing. Two play on the pianoforte, and one on the harp; and all
      sing, or would sing if they were taught, or sing all the better for not
      being taught; or something like it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know nothing of the Miss Owens,&rdquo; said Fanny calmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know nothing and you care less, as people say. Never did tone express
      indifference plainer. Indeed, how can one care for those one has never
      seen? Well, when your cousin comes back, he will find Mansfield very
      quiet; all the noisy ones gone, your brother and mine and myself. I do not
      like the idea of leaving Mrs. Grant now the time draws near. She does not
      like my going.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fanny felt obliged to speak. &ldquo;You cannot doubt your being missed by many,&rdquo;
       said she. &ldquo;You will be very much missed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Crawford turned her eye on her, as if wanting to hear or see more,
      and then laughingly said, &ldquo;Oh yes! missed as every noisy evil is missed
      when it is taken away; that is, there is a great difference felt. But I am
      not fishing; don&rsquo;t compliment me. If I <i>am</i> missed, it will appear. I
      may be discovered by those who want to see me. I shall not be in any
      doubtful, or distant, or unapproachable region.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now Fanny could not bring herself to speak, and Miss Crawford was
      disappointed; for she had hoped to hear some pleasant assurance of her
      power from one who she thought must know, and her spirits were clouded
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Miss Owens,&rdquo; said she, soon afterwards; &ldquo;suppose you were to have one
      of the Miss Owens settled at Thornton Lacey; how should you like it?
      Stranger things have happened. I dare say they are trying for it. And they
      are quite in the right, for it would be a very pretty establishment for
      them. I do not at all wonder or blame them. It is everybody&rsquo;s duty to do
      as well for themselves as they can. Sir Thomas Bertram&rsquo;s son is somebody;
      and now he is in their own line. Their father is a clergyman, and their
      brother is a clergyman, and they are all clergymen together. He is their
      lawful property; he fairly belongs to them. You don&rsquo;t speak, Fanny; Miss
      Price, you don&rsquo;t speak. But honestly now, do not you rather expect it than
      otherwise?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Fanny stoutly, &ldquo;I do not expect it at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all!&rdquo; cried Miss Crawford with alacrity. &ldquo;I wonder at that. But I
      dare say you know exactly&mdash;I always imagine you are&mdash;perhaps you
      do not think him likely to marry at all&mdash;or not at present.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I do not,&rdquo; said Fanny softly, hoping she did not err either in the
      belief or the acknowledgment of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her companion looked at her keenly; and gathering greater spirit from the
      blush soon produced from such a look, only said, &ldquo;He is best off as he
      is,&rdquo; and turned the subject.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXX
    </h2>
    <p>
      Miss Crawford&rsquo;s uneasiness was much lightened by this conversation, and
      she walked home again in spirits which might have defied almost another
      week of the same small party in the same bad weather, had they been put to
      the proof; but as that very evening brought her brother down from London
      again in quite, or more than quite, his usual cheerfulness, she had
      nothing farther to try her own. His still refusing to tell her what he had
      gone for was but the promotion of gaiety; a day before it might have
      irritated, but now it was a pleasant joke&mdash;suspected only of
      concealing something planned as a pleasant surprise to herself. And the
      next day <i>did</i> bring a surprise to her. Henry had said he should just
      go and ask the Bertrams how they did, and be back in ten minutes, but he
      was gone above an hour; and when his sister, who had been waiting for him
      to walk with her in the garden, met him at last most impatiently in the
      sweep, and cried out, &ldquo;My dear Henry, where can you have been all this
      time?&rdquo; he had only to say that he had been sitting with Lady Bertram and
      Fanny.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sitting with them an hour and a half!&rdquo; exclaimed Mary.
    </p>
    <p>
      But this was only the beginning of her surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Mary,&rdquo; said he, drawing her arm within his, and walking along the
      sweep as if not knowing where he was: &ldquo;I could not get away sooner; Fanny
      looked so lovely! I am quite determined, Mary. My mind is entirely made
      up. Will it astonish you? No: you must be aware that I am quite determined
      to marry Fanny Price.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The surprise was now complete; for, in spite of whatever his consciousness
      might suggest, a suspicion of his having any such views had never entered
      his sister&rsquo;s imagination; and she looked so truly the astonishment she
      felt, that he was obliged to repeat what he had said, and more fully and
      more solemnly. The conviction of his determination once admitted, it was
      not unwelcome. There was even pleasure with the surprise. Mary was in a
      state of mind to rejoice in a connexion with the Bertram family, and to be
      not displeased with her brother&rsquo;s marrying a little beneath him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Mary,&rdquo; was Henry&rsquo;s concluding assurance. &ldquo;I am fairly caught. You
      know with what idle designs I began; but this is the end of them. I have,
      I flatter myself, made no inconsiderable progress in her affections; but
      my own are entirely fixed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lucky, lucky girl!&rdquo; cried Mary, as soon as she could speak; &ldquo;what a match
      for her! My dearest Henry, this must be my <i>first</i> feeling; but my <i>second</i>,
      which you shall have as sincerely, is, that I approve your choice from my
      soul, and foresee your happiness as heartily as I wish and desire it. You
      will have a sweet little wife; all gratitude and devotion. Exactly what
      you deserve. What an amazing match for her! Mrs. Norris often talks of her
      luck; what will she say now? The delight of all the family, indeed! And
      she has some <i>true</i> friends in it! How <i>they</i> will rejoice! But
      tell me all about it! Talk to me for ever. When did you begin to think
      seriously about her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nothing could be more impossible than to answer such a question, though
      nothing could be more agreeable than to have it asked. &ldquo;How the pleasing
      plague had stolen on him&rdquo; he could not say; and before he had expressed
      the same sentiment with a little variation of words three times over, his
      sister eagerly interrupted him with, &ldquo;Ah, my dear Henry, and this is what
      took you to London! This was your business! You chose to consult the
      Admiral before you made up your mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But this he stoutly denied. He knew his uncle too well to consult him on
      any matrimonial scheme. The Admiral hated marriage, and thought it never
      pardonable in a young man of independent fortune.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When Fanny is known to him,&rdquo; continued Henry, &ldquo;he will doat on her. She
      is exactly the woman to do away every prejudice of such a man as the
      Admiral, for she he would describe, if indeed he has now delicacy of
      language enough to embody his own ideas. But till it is absolutely settled&mdash;settled
      beyond all interference, he shall know nothing of the matter. No, Mary,
      you are quite mistaken. You have not discovered my business yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well, I am satisfied. I know now to whom it must relate, and am in
      no hurry for the rest. Fanny Price! wonderful, quite wonderful! That
      Mansfield should have done so much for&mdash;that <i>you</i> should have
      found your fate in Mansfield! But you are quite right; you could not have
      chosen better. There is not a better girl in the world, and you do not
      want for fortune; and as to her connexions, they are more than good. The
      Bertrams are undoubtedly some of the first people in this country. She is
      niece to Sir Thomas Bertram; that will be enough for the world. But go on,
      go on. Tell me more. What are your plans? Does she know her own
      happiness?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you waiting for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For&mdash;for very little more than opportunity. Mary, she is not like
      her cousins; but I think I shall not ask in vain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh no! you cannot. Were you even less pleasing&mdash;supposing her not to
      love you already (of which, however, I can have little doubt)&mdash;you
      would be safe. The gentleness and gratitude of her disposition would
      secure her all your own immediately. From my soul I do not think she would
      marry you <i>without</i> love; that is, if there is a girl in the world
      capable of being uninfluenced by ambition, I can suppose it her; but ask
      her to love you, and she will never have the heart to refuse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As soon as her eagerness could rest in silence, he was as happy to tell as
      she could be to listen; and a conversation followed almost as deeply
      interesting to her as to himself, though he had in fact nothing to relate
      but his own sensations, nothing to dwell on but Fanny&rsquo;s charms. Fanny&rsquo;s
      beauty of face and figure, Fanny&rsquo;s graces of manner and goodness of heart,
      were the exhaustless theme. The gentleness, modesty, and sweetness of her
      character were warmly expatiated on; that sweetness which makes so
      essential a part of every woman&rsquo;s worth in the judgment of man, that
      though he sometimes loves where it is not, he can never believe it absent.
      Her temper he had good reason to depend on and to praise. He had often
      seen it tried. Was there one of the family, excepting Edmund, who had not
      in some way or other continually exercised her patience and forbearance?
      Her affections were evidently strong. To see her with her brother! What
      could more delightfully prove that the warmth of her heart was equal to
      its gentleness? What could be more encouraging to a man who had her love
      in view? Then, her understanding was beyond every suspicion, quick and
      clear; and her manners were the mirror of her own modest and elegant mind.
      Nor was this all. Henry Crawford had too much sense not to feel the worth
      of good principles in a wife, though he was too little accustomed to
      serious reflection to know them by their proper name; but when he talked
      of her having such a steadiness and regularity of conduct, such a high
      notion of honour, and such an observance of decorum as might warrant any
      man in the fullest dependence on her faith and integrity, he expressed
      what was inspired by the knowledge of her being well principled and
      religious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could so wholly and absolutely confide in her,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;and <i>that</i>
      is what I want.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Well might his sister, believing as she really did that his opinion of
      Fanny Price was scarcely beyond her merits, rejoice in her prospects.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The more I think of it,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;the more am I convinced that you are
      doing quite right; and though I should never have selected Fanny Price as
      the girl most likely to attach you, I am now persuaded she is the very one
      to make you happy. Your wicked project upon her peace turns out a clever
      thought indeed. You will both find your good in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was bad, very bad in me against such a creature; but I did not know
      her then; and she shall have no reason to lament the hour that first put
      it into my head. I will make her very happy, Mary; happier than she has
      ever yet been herself, or ever seen anybody else. I will not take her from
      Northamptonshire. I shall let Everingham, and rent a place in this
      neighbourhood; perhaps Stanwix Lodge. I shall let a seven years&rsquo; lease of
      Everingham. I am sure of an excellent tenant at half a word. I could name
      three people now, who would give me my own terms and thank me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; cried Mary; &ldquo;settle in Northamptonshire! That is pleasant! Then we
      shall be all together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When she had spoken it, she recollected herself, and wished it unsaid; but
      there was no need of confusion; for her brother saw her only as the
      supposed inmate of Mansfield parsonage, and replied but to invite her in
      the kindest manner to his own house, and to claim the best right in her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must give us more than half your time,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I cannot admit Mrs.
      Grant to have an equal claim with Fanny and myself, for we shall both have
      a right in you. Fanny will be so truly your sister!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary had only to be grateful and give general assurances; but she was now
      very fully purposed to be the guest of neither brother nor sister many
      months longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will divide your year between London and Northamptonshire?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right; and in London, of course, a house of your own: no longer
      with the Admiral. My dearest Henry, the advantage to you of getting away
      from the Admiral before your manners are hurt by the contagion of his,
      before you have contracted any of his foolish opinions, or learned to sit
      over your dinner as if it were the best blessing of life! <i>You</i> are
      not sensible of the gain, for your regard for him has blinded you; but, in
      my estimation, your marrying early may be the saving of you. To have seen
      you grow like the Admiral in word or deed, look or gesture, would have
      broken my heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well, we do not think quite alike here. The Admiral has his faults,
      but he is a very good man, and has been more than a father to me. Few
      fathers would have let me have my own way half so much. You must not
      prejudice Fanny against him. I must have them love one another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary refrained from saying what she felt, that there could not be two
      persons in existence whose characters and manners were less accordant:
      time would discover it to him; but she could not help <i>this</i>
      reflection on the Admiral. &ldquo;Henry, I think so highly of Fanny Price, that
      if I could suppose the next Mrs. Crawford would have half the reason which
      my poor ill-used aunt had to abhor the very name, I would prevent the
      marriage, if possible; but I know you: I know that a wife you <i>loved</i>
      would be the happiest of women, and that even when you ceased to love, she
      would yet find in you the liberality and good-breeding of a gentleman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The impossibility of not doing everything in the world to make Fanny Price
      happy, or of ceasing to love Fanny Price, was of course the groundwork of
      his eloquent answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Had you seen her this morning, Mary,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;attending with such
      ineffable sweetness and patience to all the demands of her aunt&rsquo;s
      stupidity, working with her, and for her, her colour beautifully
      heightened as she leant over the work, then returning to her seat to
      finish a note which she was previously engaged in writing for that stupid
      woman&rsquo;s service, and all this with such unpretending gentleness, so much
      as if it were a matter of course that she was not to have a moment at her
      own command, her hair arranged as neatly as it always is, and one little
      curl falling forward as she wrote, which she now and then shook back, and
      in the midst of all this, still speaking at intervals to <i>me</i>, or
      listening, and as if she liked to listen, to what I said. Had you seen her
      so, Mary, you would not have implied the possibility of her power over my
      heart ever ceasing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dearest Henry,&rdquo; cried Mary, stopping short, and smiling in his face,
      &ldquo;how glad I am to see you so much in love! It quite delights me. But what
      will Mrs. Rushworth and Julia say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I care neither what they say nor what they feel. They will now see what
      sort of woman it is that can attach me, that can attach a man of sense. I
      wish the discovery may do them any good. And they will now see their
      cousin treated as she ought to be, and I wish they may be heartily ashamed
      of their own abominable neglect and unkindness. They will be angry,&rdquo; he
      added, after a moment&rsquo;s silence, and in a cooler tone; &ldquo;Mrs. Rushworth
      will be very angry. It will be a bitter pill to her; that is, like other
      bitter pills, it will have two moments&rsquo; ill flavour, and then be swallowed
      and forgotten; for I am not such a coxcomb as to suppose her feelings more
      lasting than other women&rsquo;s, though <i>I</i> was the object of them. Yes,
      Mary, my Fanny will feel a difference indeed: a daily, hourly difference,
      in the behaviour of every being who approaches her; and it will be the
      completion of my happiness to know that I am the doer of it, that I am the
      person to give the consequence so justly her due. Now she is dependent,
      helpless, friendless, neglected, forgotten.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, Henry, not by all; not forgotten by all; not friendless or
      forgotten. Her cousin Edmund never forgets her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Edmund! True, I believe he is, generally speaking, kind to her, and so is
      Sir Thomas in his way; but it is the way of a rich, superior, long-worded,
      arbitrary uncle. What can Sir Thomas and Edmund together do, what do they
      <i>do</i> for her happiness, comfort, honour, and dignity in the world, to
      what I <i>shall</i> do?&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XXXI

    <p>
      Henry Crawford was at Mansfield Park again the next morning, and at an
      earlier hour than common visiting warrants. The two ladies were together
      in the breakfast-room, and, fortunately for him, Lady Bertram was on the
      very point of quitting it as he entered. She was almost at the door, and
      not chusing by any means to take so much trouble in vain, she still went
      on, after a civil reception, a short sentence about being waited for, and
      a &ldquo;Let Sir Thomas know&rdquo; to the servant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry, overjoyed to have her go, bowed and watched her off, and without
      losing another moment, turned instantly to Fanny, and, taking out some
      letters, said, with a most animated look, &ldquo;I must acknowledge myself
      infinitely obliged to any creature who gives me such an opportunity of
      seeing you alone: I have been wishing it more than you can have any idea.
      Knowing as I do what your feelings as a sister are, I could hardly have
      borne that any one in the house should share with you in the first
      knowledge of the news I now bring. He is made. Your brother is a
      lieutenant. I have the infinite satisfaction of congratulating you on your
      brother&rsquo;s promotion. Here are the letters which announce it, this moment
      come to hand. You will, perhaps, like to see them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fanny could not speak, but he did not want her to speak. To see the
      expression of her eyes, the change of her complexion, the progress of her
      feelings, their doubt, confusion, and felicity, was enough. She took the
      letters as he gave them. The first was from the Admiral to inform his
      nephew, in a few words, of his having succeeded in the object he had
      undertaken, the promotion of young Price, and enclosing two more, one from
      the Secretary of the First Lord to a friend, whom the Admiral had set to
      work in the business, the other from that friend to himself, by which it
      appeared that his lordship had the very great happiness of attending to
      the recommendation of Sir Charles; that Sir Charles was much delighted in
      having such an opportunity of proving his regard for Admiral Crawford, and
      that the circumstance of Mr. William Price&rsquo;s commission as Second
      Lieutenant of H.M. Sloop Thrush being made out was spreading general joy
      through a wide circle of great people.
    </p>
    <p>
      While her hand was trembling under these letters, her eye running from one
      to the other, and her heart swelling with emotion, Crawford thus
      continued, with unfeigned eagerness, to express his interest in the event&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not talk of my own happiness,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;great as it is, for I
      think only of yours. Compared with you, who has a right to be happy? I
      have almost grudged myself my own prior knowledge of what you ought to
      have known before all the world. I have not lost a moment, however. The
      post was late this morning, but there has not been since a moment&rsquo;s delay.
      How impatient, how anxious, how wild I have been on the subject, I will
      not attempt to describe; how severely mortified, how cruelly disappointed,
      in not having it finished while I was in London! I was kept there from day
      to day in the hope of it, for nothing less dear to me than such an object
      would have detained me half the time from Mansfield. But though my uncle
      entered into my wishes with all the warmth I could desire, and exerted
      himself immediately, there were difficulties from the absence of one
      friend, and the engagements of another, which at last I could no longer
      bear to stay the end of, and knowing in what good hands I left the cause,
      I came away on Monday, trusting that many posts would not pass before I
      should be followed by such very letters as these. My uncle, who is the
      very best man in the world, has exerted himself, as I knew he would, after
      seeing your brother. He was delighted with him. I would not allow myself
      yesterday to say how delighted, or to repeat half that the Admiral said in
      his praise. I deferred it all till his praise should be proved the praise
      of a friend, as this day <i>does</i> prove it. <i>Now</i> I may say that
      even I could not require William Price to excite a greater interest, or be
      followed by warmer wishes and higher commendation, than were most
      voluntarily bestowed by my uncle after the evening they had passed
      together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has this been all <i>your</i> doing, then?&rdquo; cried Fanny. &ldquo;Good heaven!
      how very, very kind! Have you really&mdash;was it by <i>your</i> desire? I
      beg your pardon, but I am bewildered. Did Admiral Crawford apply? How was
      it? I am stupefied.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Henry was most happy to make it more intelligible, by beginning at an
      earlier stage, and explaining very particularly what he had done. His last
      journey to London had been undertaken with no other view than that of
      introducing her brother in Hill Street, and prevailing on the Admiral to
      exert whatever interest he might have for getting him on. This had been
      his business. He had communicated it to no creature: he had not breathed a
      syllable of it even to Mary; while uncertain of the issue, he could not
      have borne any participation of his feelings, but this had been his
      business; and he spoke with such a glow of what his solicitude had been,
      and used such strong expressions, was so abounding in the <i>deepest</i>
      <i>interest</i>, in <i>twofold</i> <i>motives</i>, in <i>views</i> <i>and</i>
      <i>wishes</i> <i>more</i> <i>than</i> <i>could</i> <i>be</i> <i>told</i>,
      that Fanny could not have remained insensible of his drift, had she been
      able to attend; but her heart was so full and her senses still so
      astonished, that she could listen but imperfectly even to what he told her
      of William, and saying only when he paused, &ldquo;How kind! how very kind! Oh,
      Mr. Crawford, we are infinitely obliged to you! Dearest, dearest William!&rdquo;
       She jumped up and moved in haste towards the door, crying out, &ldquo;I will go
      to my uncle. My uncle ought to know it as soon as possible.&rdquo; But this
      could not be suffered. The opportunity was too fair, and his feelings too
      impatient. He was after her immediately. &ldquo;She must not go, she must allow
      him five minutes longer,&rdquo; and he took her hand and led her back to her
      seat, and was in the middle of his farther explanation, before she had
      suspected for what she was detained. When she did understand it, however,
      and found herself expected to believe that she had created sensations
      which his heart had never known before, and that everything he had done
      for William was to be placed to the account of his excessive and
      unequalled attachment to her, she was exceedingly distressed, and for some
      moments unable to speak. She considered it all as nonsense, as mere
      trifling and gallantry, which meant only to deceive for the hour; she
      could not but feel that it was treating her improperly and unworthily, and
      in such a way as she had not deserved; but it was like himself, and
      entirely of a piece with what she had seen before; and she would not allow
      herself to shew half the displeasure she felt, because he had been
      conferring an obligation, which no want of delicacy on his part could make
      a trifle to her. While her heart was still bounding with joy and gratitude
      on William&rsquo;s behalf, she could not be severely resentful of anything that
      injured only herself; and after having twice drawn back her hand, and
      twice attempted in vain to turn away from him, she got up, and said only,
      with much agitation, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t, Mr. Crawford, pray don&rsquo;t! I beg you would
      not. This is a sort of talking which is very unpleasant to me. I must go
      away. I cannot bear it.&rdquo; But he was still talking on, describing his
      affection, soliciting a return, and, finally, in words so plain as to bear
      but one meaning even to her, offering himself, hand, fortune, everything,
      to her acceptance. It was so; he had said it. Her astonishment and
      confusion increased; and though still not knowing how to suppose him
      serious, she could hardly stand. He pressed for an answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, no!&rdquo; she cried, hiding her face. &ldquo;This is all nonsense. Do not
      distress me. I can hear no more of this. Your kindness to William makes me
      more obliged to you than words can express; but I do not want, I cannot
      bear, I must not listen to such&mdash;No, no, don&rsquo;t think of me. But you
      are <i>not</i> thinking of me. I know it is all nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had burst away from him, and at that moment Sir Thomas was heard
      speaking to a servant in his way towards the room they were in. It was no
      time for farther assurances or entreaty, though to part with her at a
      moment when her modesty alone seemed, to his sanguine and preassured mind,
      to stand in the way of the happiness he sought, was a cruel necessity. She
      rushed out at an opposite door from the one her uncle was approaching, and
      was walking up and down the East room in the utmost confusion of contrary
      feeling, before Sir Thomas&rsquo;s politeness or apologies were over, or he had
      reached the beginning of the joyful intelligence which his visitor came to
      communicate.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was feeling, thinking, trembling about everything; agitated, happy,
      miserable, infinitely obliged, absolutely angry. It was all beyond belief!
      He was inexcusable, incomprehensible! But such were his habits that he
      could do nothing without a mixture of evil. He had previously made her the
      happiest of human beings, and now he had insulted&mdash;she knew not what
      to say, how to class, or how to regard it. She would not have him be
      serious, and yet what could excuse the use of such words and offers, if
      they meant but to trifle?
    </p>
    <p>
      But William was a lieutenant. <i>That</i> was a fact beyond a doubt, and
      without an alloy. She would think of it for ever and forget all the rest.
      Mr. Crawford would certainly never address her so again: he must have seen
      how unwelcome it was to her; and in that case, how gratefully she could
      esteem him for his friendship to William!
    </p>
    <p>
      She would not stir farther from the East room than the head of the great
      staircase, till she had satisfied herself of Mr. Crawford&rsquo;s having left
      the house; but when convinced of his being gone, she was eager to go down
      and be with her uncle, and have all the happiness of his joy as well as
      her own, and all the benefit of his information or his conjectures as to
      what would now be William&rsquo;s destination. Sir Thomas was as joyful as she
      could desire, and very kind and communicative; and she had so comfortable
      a talk with him about William as to make her feel as if nothing had
      occurred to vex her, till she found, towards the close, that Mr. Crawford
      was engaged to return and dine there that very day. This was a most
      unwelcome hearing, for though he might think nothing of what had passed,
      it would be quite distressing to her to see him again so soon.
    </p>
    <p>
      She tried to get the better of it; tried very hard, as the dinner hour
      approached, to feel and appear as usual; but it was quite impossible for
      her not to look most shy and uncomfortable when their visitor entered the
      room. She could not have supposed it in the power of any concurrence of
      circumstances to give her so many painful sensations on the first day of
      hearing of William&rsquo;s promotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Crawford was not only in the room&mdash;he was soon close to her. He
      had a note to deliver from his sister. Fanny could not look at him, but
      there was no consciousness of past folly in his voice. She opened her note
      immediately, glad to have anything to do, and happy, as she read it, to
      feel that the fidgetings of her aunt Norris, who was also to dine there,
      screened her a little from view.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Fanny,&mdash;for so I may now always call you, to the infinite
      relief of a tongue that has been stumbling at <i>Miss</i> <i>Price</i> for
      at least the last six weeks&mdash;I cannot let my brother go without
      sending you a few lines of general congratulation, and giving my most
      joyful consent and approval. Go on, my dear Fanny, and without fear; there
      can be no difficulties worth naming. I chuse to suppose that the assurance
      of my consent will be something; so you may smile upon him with your
      sweetest smiles this afternoon, and send him back to me even happier than
      he goes.&mdash;Yours affectionately, M. C.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These were not expressions to do Fanny any good; for though she read in
      too much haste and confusion to form the clearest judgment of Miss
      Crawford&rsquo;s meaning, it was evident that she meant to compliment her on her
      brother&rsquo;s attachment, and even to <i>appear</i> to believe it serious. She
      did not know what to do, or what to think. There was wretchedness in the
      idea of its being serious; there was perplexity and agitation every way.
      She was distressed whenever Mr. Crawford spoke to her, and he spoke to her
      much too often; and she was afraid there was a something in his voice and
      manner in addressing her very different from what they were when he talked
      to the others. Her comfort in that day&rsquo;s dinner was quite destroyed: she
      could hardly eat anything; and when Sir Thomas good-humouredly observed
      that joy had taken away her appetite, she was ready to sink with shame,
      from the dread of Mr. Crawford&rsquo;s interpretation; for though nothing could
      have tempted her to turn her eyes to the right hand, where he sat, she
      felt that <i>his</i> were immediately directed towards her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was more silent than ever. She would hardly join even when William was
      the subject, for his commission came all from the right hand too, and
      there was pain in the connexion.
    </p>
    <p>
      She thought Lady Bertram sat longer than ever, and began to be in despair
      of ever getting away; but at last they were in the drawing-room, and she
      was able to think as she would, while her aunts finished the subject of
      William&rsquo;s appointment in their own style.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Norris seemed as much delighted with the saving it would be to Sir
      Thomas as with any part of it. &ldquo;<i>Now</i> William would be able to keep
      himself, which would make a vast difference to his uncle, for it was
      unknown how much he had cost his uncle; and, indeed, it would make some
      difference in <i>her</i> presents too. She was very glad that she had
      given William what she did at parting, very glad, indeed, that it had been
      in her power, without material inconvenience, just at that time to give
      him something rather considerable; that is, for <i>her</i>, with <i>her</i>
      limited means, for now it would all be useful in helping to fit up his
      cabin. She knew he must be at some expense, that he would have many things
      to buy, though to be sure his father and mother would be able to put him
      in the way of getting everything very cheap; but she was very glad she had
      contributed her mite towards it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad you gave him something considerable,&rdquo; said Lady Bertram, with
      most unsuspicious calmness, &ldquo;for <i>I</i> gave him only &#163;10.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Norris, reddening. &ldquo;Upon my word, he must have gone
      off with his pockets well lined, and at no expense for his journey to
      London either!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir Thomas told me &#163;10 would be enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Norris, being not at all inclined to question its sufficiency, began
      to take the matter in another point.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is amazing,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;how much young people cost their friends, what
      with bringing them up and putting them out in the world! They little think
      how much it comes to, or what their parents, or their uncles and aunts,
      pay for them in the course of the year. Now, here are my sister Price&rsquo;s
      children; take them all together, I dare say nobody would believe what a
      sum they cost Sir Thomas every year, to say nothing of what <i>I</i> do
      for them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very true, sister, as you say. But, poor things! they cannot help it; and
      you know it makes very little difference to Sir Thomas. Fanny, William
      must not forget my shawl if he goes to the East Indies; and I shall give
      him a commission for anything else that is worth having. I wish he may go
      to the East Indies, that I may have my shawl. I think I will have two
      shawls, Fanny.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fanny, meanwhile, speaking only when she could not help it, was very
      earnestly trying to understand what Mr. and Miss Crawford were at. There
      was everything in the world <i>against</i> their being serious but his
      words and manner. Everything natural, probable, reasonable, was against
      it; all their habits and ways of thinking, and all her own demerits. How
      could <i>she</i> have excited serious attachment in a man who had seen so
      many, and been admired by so many, and flirted with so many, infinitely
      her superiors; who seemed so little open to serious impressions, even
      where pains had been taken to please him; who thought so slightly, so
      carelessly, so unfeelingly on all such points; who was everything to
      everybody, and seemed to find no one essential to him? And farther, how
      could it be supposed that his sister, with all her high and worldly
      notions of matrimony, would be forwarding anything of a serious nature in
      such a quarter? Nothing could be more unnatural in either. Fanny was
      ashamed of her own doubts. Everything might be possible rather than
      serious attachment, or serious approbation of it toward her. She had quite
      convinced herself of this before Sir Thomas and Mr. Crawford joined them.
      The difficulty was in maintaining the conviction quite so absolutely after
      Mr. Crawford was in the room; for once or twice a look seemed forced on
      her which she did not know how to class among the common meaning; in any
      other man, at least, she would have said that it meant something very
      earnest, very pointed. But she still tried to believe it no more than what
      he might often have expressed towards her cousins and fifty other women.
    </p>
    <p>
      She thought he was wishing to speak to her unheard by the rest. She
      fancied he was trying for it the whole evening at intervals, whenever Sir
      Thomas was out of the room, or at all engaged with Mrs. Norris, and she
      carefully refused him every opportunity.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last&mdash;it seemed an at last to Fanny&rsquo;s nervousness, though not
      remarkably late&mdash;he began to talk of going away; but the comfort of
      the sound was impaired by his turning to her the next moment, and saying,
      &ldquo;Have you nothing to send to Mary? No answer to her note? She will be
      disappointed if she receives nothing from you. Pray write to her, if it be
      only a line.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes! certainly,&rdquo; cried Fanny, rising in haste, the haste of
      embarrassment and of wanting to get away&mdash;&ldquo;I will write directly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She went accordingly to the table, where she was in the habit of writing
      for her aunt, and prepared her materials without knowing what in the world
      to say. She had read Miss Crawford&rsquo;s note only once, and how to reply to
      anything so imperfectly understood was most distressing. Quite unpractised
      in such sort of note-writing, had there been time for scruples and fears
      as to style she would have felt them in abundance: but something must be
      instantly written; and with only one decided feeling, that of wishing not
      to appear to think anything really intended, she wrote thus, in great
      trembling both of spirits and hand&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very much obliged to you, my dear Miss Crawford, for your kind
      congratulations, as far as they relate to my dearest William. The rest of
      your note I know means nothing; but I am so unequal to anything of the
      sort, that I hope you will excuse my begging you to take no farther
      notice. I have seen too much of Mr. Crawford not to understand his
      manners; if he understood me as well, he would, I dare say, behave
      differently. I do not know what I write, but it would be a great favour of
      you never to mention the subject again. With thanks for the honour of your
      note, I remain, dear Miss Crawford, etc., etc.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The conclusion was scarcely intelligible from increasing fright, for she
      found that Mr. Crawford, under pretence of receiving the note, was coming
      towards her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You cannot think I mean to hurry you,&rdquo; said he, in an undervoice,
      perceiving the amazing trepidation with which she made up the note, &ldquo;you
      cannot think I have any such object. Do not hurry yourself, I entreat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I thank you; I have quite done, just done; it will be ready in a
      moment; I am very much obliged to you; if you will be so good as to give
      <i>that</i> to Miss Crawford.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The note was held out, and must be taken; and as she instantly and with
      averted eyes walked towards the fireplace, where sat the others, he had
      nothing to do but to go in good earnest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fanny thought she had never known a day of greater agitation, both of pain
      and pleasure; but happily the pleasure was not of a sort to die with the
      day; for every day would restore the knowledge of William&rsquo;s advancement,
      whereas the pain, she hoped, would return no more. She had no doubt that
      her note must appear excessively ill-written, that the language would
      disgrace a child, for her distress had allowed no arrangement; but at
      least it would assure them both of her being neither imposed on nor
      gratified by Mr. Crawford&rsquo;s attentions.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Fanny had by no means forgotten Mr. Crawford when she awoke the next
      morning; but she remembered the purport of her note, and was not less
      sanguine as to its effect than she had been the night before. If Mr.
      Crawford would but go away! That was what she most earnestly desired: go
      and take his sister with him, as he was to do, and as he returned to
      Mansfield on purpose to do. And why it was not done already she could not
      devise, for Miss Crawford certainly wanted no delay. Fanny had hoped, in
      the course of his yesterday&rsquo;s visit, to hear the day named; but he had
      only spoken of their journey as what would take place ere long.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having so satisfactorily settled the conviction her note would convey, she
      could not but be astonished to see Mr. Crawford, as she accidentally did,
      coming up to the house again, and at an hour as early as the day before.
      His coming might have nothing to do with her, but she must avoid seeing
      him if possible; and being then on her way upstairs, she resolved there to
      remain, during the whole of his visit, unless actually sent for; and as
      Mrs. Norris was still in the house, there seemed little danger of her
      being wanted.
    </p>
    <p>
      She sat some time in a good deal of agitation, listening, trembling, and
      fearing to be sent for every moment; but as no footsteps approached the
      East room, she grew gradually composed, could sit down, and be able to
      employ herself, and able to hope that Mr. Crawford had come and would go
      without her being obliged to know anything of the matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nearly half an hour had passed, and she was growing very comfortable, when
      suddenly the sound of a step in regular approach was heard; a heavy step,
      an unusual step in that part of the house: it was her uncle&rsquo;s; she knew it
      as well as his voice; she had trembled at it as often, and began to
      tremble again, at the idea of his coming up to speak to her, whatever
      might be the subject. It was indeed Sir Thomas who opened the door and
      asked if she were there, and if he might come in. The terror of his former
      occasional visits to that room seemed all renewed, and she felt as if he
      were going to examine her again in French and English.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was all attention, however, in placing a chair for him, and trying to
      appear honoured; and, in her agitation, had quite overlooked the
      deficiencies of her apartment, till he, stopping short as he entered,
      said, with much surprise, &ldquo;Why have you no fire to-day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was snow on the ground, and she was sitting in a shawl. She
      hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not cold, sir: I never sit here long at this time of year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you have a fire in general?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How comes this about? Here must be some mistake. I understood that you
      had the use of this room by way of making you perfectly comfortable. In
      your bedchamber I know you <i>cannot</i> have a fire. Here is some great
      misapprehension which must be rectified. It is highly unfit for you to
      sit, be it only half an hour a day, without a fire. You are not strong.
      You are chilly. Your aunt cannot be aware of this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fanny would rather have been silent; but being obliged to speak, she could
      not forbear, in justice to the aunt she loved best, from saying something
      in which the words &ldquo;my aunt Norris&rdquo; were distinguishable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; cried her uncle, recollecting himself, and not wanting to
      hear more: &ldquo;I understand. Your aunt Norris has always been an advocate,
      and very judiciously, for young people&rsquo;s being brought up without
      unnecessary indulgences; but there should be moderation in everything. She
      is also very hardy herself, which of course will influence her in her
      opinion of the wants of others. And on another account, too, I can
      perfectly comprehend. I know what her sentiments have always been. The
      principle was good in itself, but it may have been, and I believe <i>has</i>
      <i>been</i>, carried too far in your case. I am aware that there has been
      sometimes, in some points, a misplaced distinction; but I think too well
      of you, Fanny, to suppose you will ever harbour resentment on that
      account. You have an understanding which will prevent you from receiving
      things only in part, and judging partially by the event. You will take in
      the whole of the past, you will consider times, persons, and
      probabilities, and you will feel that <i>they</i> were not least your
      friends who were educating and preparing you for that mediocrity of
      condition which <i>seemed</i> to be your lot. Though their caution may
      prove eventually unnecessary, it was kindly meant; and of this you may be
      assured, that every advantage of affluence will be doubled by the little
      privations and restrictions that may have been imposed. I am sure you will
      not disappoint my opinion of you, by failing at any time to treat your
      aunt Norris with the respect and attention that are due to her. But enough
      of this. Sit down, my dear. I must speak to you for a few minutes, but I
      will not detain you long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fanny obeyed, with eyes cast down and colour rising. After a moment&rsquo;s
      pause, Sir Thomas, trying to suppress a smile, went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not aware, perhaps, that I have had a visitor this morning. I had
      not been long in my own room, after breakfast, when Mr. Crawford was shewn
      in. His errand you may probably conjecture.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fanny&rsquo;s colour grew deeper and deeper; and her uncle, perceiving that she
      was embarrassed to a degree that made either speaking or looking up quite
      impossible, turned away his own eyes, and without any farther pause
      proceeded in his account of Mr. Crawford&rsquo;s visit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Crawford&rsquo;s business had been to declare himself the lover of Fanny,
      make decided proposals for her, and entreat the sanction of the uncle, who
      seemed to stand in the place of her parents; and he had done it all so
      well, so openly, so liberally, so properly, that Sir Thomas, feeling,
      moreover, his own replies, and his own remarks to have been very much to
      the purpose, was exceedingly happy to give the particulars of their
      conversation; and little aware of what was passing in his niece&rsquo;s mind,
      conceived that by such details he must be gratifying her far more than
      himself. He talked, therefore, for several minutes without Fanny&rsquo;s daring
      to interrupt him. She had hardly even attained the wish to do it. Her mind
      was in too much confusion. She had changed her position; and, with her
      eyes fixed intently on one of the windows, was listening to her uncle in
      the utmost perturbation and dismay. For a moment he ceased, but she had
      barely become conscious of it, when, rising from his chair, he said, &ldquo;And
      now, Fanny, having performed one part of my commission, and shewn you
      everything placed on a basis the most assured and satisfactory, I may
      execute the remainder by prevailing on you to accompany me downstairs,
      where, though I cannot but presume on having been no unacceptable
      companion myself, I must submit to your finding one still better worth
      listening to. Mr. Crawford, as you have perhaps foreseen, is yet in the
      house. He is in my room, and hoping to see you there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a look, a start, an exclamation on hearing this, which
      astonished Sir Thomas; but what was his increase of astonishment on
      hearing her exclaim&mdash;&ldquo;Oh! no, sir, I cannot, indeed I cannot go down
      to him. Mr. Crawford ought to know&mdash;he must know that: I told him
      enough yesterday to convince him; he spoke to me on this subject
      yesterday, and I told him without disguise that it was very disagreeable
      to me, and quite out of my power to return his good opinion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not catch your meaning,&rdquo; said Sir Thomas, sitting down again. &ldquo;Out
      of your power to return his good opinion? What is all this? I know he
      spoke to you yesterday, and (as far as I understand) received as much
      encouragement to proceed as a well-judging young woman could permit
      herself to give. I was very much pleased with what I collected to have
      been your behaviour on the occasion; it shewed a discretion highly to be
      commended. But now, when he has made his overtures so properly, and
      honourably&mdash;what are your scruples <i>now</i>?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are mistaken, sir,&rdquo; cried Fanny, forced by the anxiety of the moment
      even to tell her uncle that he was wrong; &ldquo;you are quite mistaken. How
      could Mr. Crawford say such a thing? I gave him no encouragement
      yesterday. On the contrary, I told him, I cannot recollect my exact words,
      but I am sure I told him that I would not listen to him, that it was very
      unpleasant to me in every respect, and that I begged him never to talk to
      me in that manner again. I am sure I said as much as that and more; and I
      should have said still more, if I had been quite certain of his meaning
      anything seriously; but I did not like to be, I could not bear to be,
      imputing more than might be intended. I thought it might all pass for
      nothing with <i>him</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She could say no more; her breath was almost gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I to understand,&rdquo; said Sir Thomas, after a few moments&rsquo; silence, &ldquo;that
      you mean to <i>refuse</i> Mr. Crawford?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Refuse him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Refuse Mr. Crawford! Upon what plea? For what reason?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I cannot like him, sir, well enough to marry him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is very strange!&rdquo; said Sir Thomas, in a voice of calm displeasure.
      &ldquo;There is something in this which my comprehension does not reach. Here is
      a young man wishing to pay his addresses to you, with everything to
      recommend him: not merely situation in life, fortune, and character, but
      with more than common agreeableness, with address and conversation
      pleasing to everybody. And he is not an acquaintance of to-day; you have
      now known him some time. His sister, moreover, is your intimate friend,
      and he has been doing <i>that</i> for your brother, which I should suppose
      would have been almost sufficient recommendation to you, had there been no
      other. It is very uncertain when my interest might have got William on. He
      has done it already.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Fanny, in a faint voice, and looking down with fresh shame;
      and she did feel almost ashamed of herself, after such a picture as her
      uncle had drawn, for not liking Mr. Crawford.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must have been aware,&rdquo; continued Sir Thomas presently, &ldquo;you must have
      been some time aware of a particularity in Mr. Crawford&rsquo;s manners to you.
      This cannot have taken you by surprise. You must have observed his
      attentions; and though you always received them very properly (I have no
      accusation to make on that head), I never perceived them to be unpleasant
      to you. I am half inclined to think, Fanny, that you do not quite know
      your own feelings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes, sir! indeed I do. His attentions were always&mdash;what I did not
      like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sir Thomas looked at her with deeper surprise. &ldquo;This is beyond me,&rdquo; said
      he. &ldquo;This requires explanation. Young as you are, and having seen scarcely
      any one, it is hardly possible that your affections&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused and eyed her fixedly. He saw her lips formed into a <i>no</i>,
      though the sound was inarticulate, but her face was like scarlet. That,
      however, in so modest a girl, might be very compatible with innocence; and
      chusing at least to appear satisfied, he quickly added, &ldquo;No, no, I know <i>that</i>
      is quite out of the question; quite impossible. Well, there is nothing
      more to be said.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And for a few minutes he did say nothing. He was deep in thought. His
      niece was deep in thought likewise, trying to harden and prepare herself
      against farther questioning. She would rather die than own the truth; and
      she hoped, by a little reflection, to fortify herself beyond betraying it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Independently of the interest which Mr. Crawford&rsquo;s <i>choice</i> seemed
      to justify&rdquo; said Sir Thomas, beginning again, and very composedly, &ldquo;his
      wishing to marry at all so early is recommendatory to me. I am an advocate
      for early marriages, where there are means in proportion, and would have
      every young man, with a sufficient income, settle as soon after
      four-and-twenty as he can. This is so much my opinion, that I am sorry to
      think how little likely my own eldest son, your cousin, Mr. Bertram, is to
      marry early; but at present, as far as I can judge, matrimony makes no
      part of his plans or thoughts. I wish he were more likely to fix.&rdquo; Here
      was a glance at Fanny. &ldquo;Edmund, I consider, from his dispositions and
      habits, as much more likely to marry early than his brother. <i>He</i>,
      indeed, I have lately thought, has seen the woman he could love, which, I
      am convinced, my eldest son has not. Am I right? Do you agree with me, my
      dear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was gently, but it was calmly said, and Sir Thomas was easy on the
      score of the cousins. But the removal of his alarm did his niece no
      service: as her unaccountableness was confirmed his displeasure increased;
      and getting up and walking about the room with a frown, which Fanny could
      picture to herself, though she dared not lift up her eyes, he shortly
      afterwards, and in a voice of authority, said, &ldquo;Have you any reason,
      child, to think ill of Mr. Crawford&rsquo;s temper?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She longed to add, &ldquo;But of his principles I have&rdquo;; but her heart sunk
      under the appalling prospect of discussion, explanation, and probably
      non-conviction. Her ill opinion of him was founded chiefly on
      observations, which, for her cousins&rsquo; sake, she could scarcely dare
      mention to their father. Maria and Julia, and especially Maria, were so
      closely implicated in Mr. Crawford&rsquo;s misconduct, that she could not give
      his character, such as she believed it, without betraying them. She had
      hoped that, to a man like her uncle, so discerning, so honourable, so
      good, the simple acknowledgment of settled <i>dislike</i> on her side
      would have been sufficient. To her infinite grief she found it was not.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Thomas came towards the table where she sat in trembling wretchedness,
      and with a good deal of cold sternness, said, &ldquo;It is of no use, I
      perceive, to talk to you. We had better put an end to this most mortifying
      conference. Mr. Crawford must not be kept longer waiting. I will,
      therefore, only add, as thinking it my duty to mark my opinion of your
      conduct, that you have disappointed every expectation I had formed, and
      proved yourself of a character the very reverse of what I had supposed.
      For I <i>had</i>, Fanny, as I think my behaviour must have shewn, formed a
      very favourable opinion of you from the period of my return to England. I
      had thought you peculiarly free from wilfulness of temper, self-conceit,
      and every tendency to that independence of spirit which prevails so much
      in modern days, even in young women, and which in young women is offensive
      and disgusting beyond all common offence. But you have now shewn me that
      you can be wilful and perverse; that you can and will decide for yourself,
      without any consideration or deference for those who have surely some
      right to guide you, without even asking their advice. You have shewn
      yourself very, very different from anything that I had imagined. The
      advantage or disadvantage of your family, of your parents, your brothers
      and sisters, never seems to have had a moment&rsquo;s share in your thoughts on
      this occasion. How <i>they</i> might be benefited, how <i>they</i> must
      rejoice in such an establishment for you, is nothing to <i>you</i>. You
      think only of yourself, and because you do not feel for Mr. Crawford
      exactly what a young heated fancy imagines to be necessary for happiness,
      you resolve to refuse him at once, without wishing even for a little time
      to consider of it, a little more time for cool consideration, and for
      really examining your own inclinations; and are, in a wild fit of folly,
      throwing away from you such an opportunity of being settled in life,
      eligibly, honourably, nobly settled, as will, probably, never occur to you
      again. Here is a young man of sense, of character, of temper, of manners,
      and of fortune, exceedingly attached to you, and seeking your hand in the
      most handsome and disinterested way; and let me tell you, Fanny, that you
      may live eighteen years longer in the world without being addressed by a
      man of half Mr. Crawford&rsquo;s estate, or a tenth part of his merits. Gladly
      would I have bestowed either of my own daughters on him. Maria is nobly
      married; but had Mr. Crawford sought Julia&rsquo;s hand, I should have given it
      to him with superior and more heartfelt satisfaction than I gave Maria&rsquo;s
      to Mr. Rushworth.&rdquo; After half a moment&rsquo;s pause: &ldquo;And I should have been
      very much surprised had either of my daughters, on receiving a proposal of
      marriage at any time which might carry with it only <i>half</i> the
      eligibility of <i>this</i>, immediately and peremptorily, and without
      paying my opinion or my regard the compliment of any consultation, put a
      decided negative on it. I should have been much surprised and much hurt by
      such a proceeding. I should have thought it a gross violation of duty and
      respect. <i>You</i> are not to be judged by the same rule. You do not owe
      me the duty of a child. But, Fanny, if your heart can acquit you of <i>ingratitude</i>&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He ceased. Fanny was by this time crying so bitterly that, angry as he
      was, he would not press that article farther. Her heart was almost broke
      by such a picture of what she appeared to him; by such accusations, so
      heavy, so multiplied, so rising in dreadful gradation! Self-willed,
      obstinate, selfish, and ungrateful. He thought her all this. She had
      deceived his expectations; she had lost his good opinion. What was to
      become of her?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very sorry,&rdquo; said she inarticulately, through her tears, &ldquo;I am very
      sorry indeed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sorry! yes, I hope you are sorry; and you will probably have reason to be
      long sorry for this day&rsquo;s transactions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it were possible for me to do otherwise&rdquo; said she, with another strong
      effort; &ldquo;but I am so perfectly convinced that I could never make him
      happy, and that I should be miserable myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Another burst of tears; but in spite of that burst, and in spite of that
      great black word <i>miserable</i>, which served to introduce it, Sir
      Thomas began to think a little relenting, a little change of inclination,
      might have something to do with it; and to augur favourably from the
      personal entreaty of the young man himself. He knew her to be very timid,
      and exceedingly nervous; and thought it not improbable that her mind might
      be in such a state as a little time, a little pressing, a little patience,
      and a little impatience, a judicious mixture of all on the lover&rsquo;s side,
      might work their usual effect on. If the gentleman would but persevere, if
      he had but love enough to persevere, Sir Thomas began to have hopes; and
      these reflections having passed across his mind and cheered it, &ldquo;Well,&rdquo;
       said he, in a tone of becoming gravity, but of less anger, &ldquo;well, child,
      dry up your tears. There is no use in these tears; they can do no good.
      You must now come downstairs with me. Mr. Crawford has been kept waiting
      too long already. You must give him your own answer: we cannot expect him
      to be satisfied with less; and you only can explain to him the grounds of
      that misconception of your sentiments, which, unfortunately for himself,
      he certainly has imbibed. I am totally unequal to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Fanny shewed such reluctance, such misery, at the idea of going down
      to him, that Sir Thomas, after a little consideration, judged it better to
      indulge her. His hopes from both gentleman and lady suffered a small
      depression in consequence; but when he looked at his niece, and saw the
      state of feature and complexion which her crying had brought her into, he
      thought there might be as much lost as gained by an immediate interview.
      With a few words, therefore, of no particular meaning, he walked off by
      himself, leaving his poor niece to sit and cry over what had passed, with
      very wretched feelings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her mind was all disorder. The past, present, future, everything was
      terrible. But her uncle&rsquo;s anger gave her the severest pain of all. Selfish
      and ungrateful! to have appeared so to him! She was miserable for ever.
      She had no one to take her part, to counsel, or speak for her. Her only
      friend was absent. He might have softened his father; but all, perhaps
      all, would think her selfish and ungrateful. She might have to endure the
      reproach again and again; she might hear it, or see it, or know it to
      exist for ever in every connexion about her. She could not but feel some
      resentment against Mr. Crawford; yet, if he really loved her, and were
      unhappy too! It was all wretchedness together.
    </p>
    <p>
      In about a quarter of an hour her uncle returned; she was almost ready to
      faint at the sight of him. He spoke calmly, however, without austerity,
      without reproach, and she revived a little. There was comfort, too, in his
      words, as well as his manner, for he began with, &ldquo;Mr. Crawford is gone: he
      has just left me. I need not repeat what has passed. I do not want to add
      to anything you may now be feeling, by an account of what he has felt.
      Suffice it, that he has behaved in the most gentlemanlike and generous
      manner, and has confirmed me in a most favourable opinion of his
      understanding, heart, and temper. Upon my representation of what you were
      suffering, he immediately, and with the greatest delicacy, ceased to urge
      to see you for the present.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here Fanny, who had looked up, looked down again. &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; continued
      her uncle, &ldquo;it cannot be supposed but that he should request to speak with
      you alone, be it only for five minutes; a request too natural, a claim too
      just to be denied. But there is no time fixed; perhaps to-morrow, or
      whenever your spirits are composed enough. For the present you have only
      to tranquillise yourself. Check these tears; they do but exhaust you. If,
      as I am willing to suppose, you wish to shew me any observance, you will
      not give way to these emotions, but endeavour to reason yourself into a
      stronger frame of mind. I advise you to go out: the air will do you good;
      go out for an hour on the gravel; you will have the shrubbery to yourself,
      and will be the better for air and exercise. And, Fanny&rdquo; (turning back
      again for a moment), &ldquo;I shall make no mention below of what has passed; I
      shall not even tell your aunt Bertram. There is no occasion for spreading
      the disappointment; say nothing about it yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was an order to be most joyfully obeyed; this was an act of kindness
      which Fanny felt at her heart. To be spared from her aunt Norris&rsquo;s
      interminable reproaches! he left her in a glow of gratitude. Anything
      might be bearable rather than such reproaches. Even to see Mr. Crawford
      would be less overpowering.
    </p>
    <p>
      She walked out directly, as her uncle recommended, and followed his advice
      throughout, as far as she could; did check her tears; did earnestly try to
      compose her spirits and strengthen her mind. She wished to prove to him
      that she did desire his comfort, and sought to regain his favour; and he
      had given her another strong motive for exertion, in keeping the whole
      affair from the knowledge of her aunts. Not to excite suspicion by her
      look or manner was now an object worth attaining; and she felt equal to
      almost anything that might save her from her aunt Norris.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was struck, quite struck, when, on returning from her walk and going
      into the East room again, the first thing which caught her eye was a fire
      lighted and burning. A fire! it seemed too much; just at that time to be
      giving her such an indulgence was exciting even painful gratitude. She
      wondered that Sir Thomas could have leisure to think of such a trifle
      again; but she soon found, from the voluntary information of the
      housemaid, who came in to attend it, that so it was to be every day. Sir
      Thomas had given orders for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must be a brute, indeed, if I can be really ungrateful!&rdquo; said she, in
      soliloquy. &ldquo;Heaven defend me from being ungrateful!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She saw nothing more of her uncle, nor of her aunt Norris, till they met
      at dinner. Her uncle&rsquo;s behaviour to her was then as nearly as possible
      what it had been before; she was sure he did not mean there should be any
      change, and that it was only her own conscience that could fancy any; but
      her aunt was soon quarrelling with her; and when she found how much and
      how unpleasantly her having only walked out without her aunt&rsquo;s knowledge
      could be dwelt on, she felt all the reason she had to bless the kindness
      which saved her from the same spirit of reproach, exerted on a more
      momentous subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I had known you were going out, I should have got you just to go as
      far as my house with some orders for Nanny,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;which I have
      since, to my very great inconvenience, been obliged to go and carry
      myself. I could very ill spare the time, and you might have saved me the
      trouble, if you would only have been so good as to let us know you were
      going out. It would have made no difference to you, I suppose, whether you
      had walked in the shrubbery or gone to my house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I recommended the shrubbery to Fanny as the driest place,&rdquo; said Sir
      Thomas.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Mrs. Norris, with a moment&rsquo;s check, &ldquo;that was very kind of you,
      Sir Thomas; but you do not know how dry the path is to my house. Fanny
      would have had quite as good a walk there, I assure you, with the
      advantage of being of some use, and obliging her aunt: it is all her
      fault. If she would but have let us know she was going out but there is a
      something about Fanny, I have often observed it before&mdash;she likes to
      go her own way to work; she does not like to be dictated to; she takes her
      own independent walk whenever she can; she certainly has a little spirit
      of secrecy, and independence, and nonsense, about her, which I would
      advise her to get the better of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As a general reflection on Fanny, Sir Thomas thought nothing could be more
      unjust, though he had been so lately expressing the same sentiments
      himself, and he tried to turn the conversation: tried repeatedly before he
      could succeed; for Mrs. Norris had not discernment enough to perceive,
      either now, or at any other time, to what degree he thought well of his
      niece, or how very far he was from wishing to have his own children&rsquo;s
      merits set off by the depreciation of hers. She was talking <i>at</i>
      Fanny, and resenting this private walk half through the dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was over, however, at last; and the evening set in with more composure
      to Fanny, and more cheerfulness of spirits than she could have hoped for
      after so stormy a morning; but she trusted, in the first place, that she
      had done right: that her judgment had not misled her. For the purity of
      her intentions she could answer; and she was willing to hope, secondly,
      that her uncle&rsquo;s displeasure was abating, and would abate farther as he
      considered the matter with more impartiality, and felt, as a good man must
      feel, how wretched, and how unpardonable, how hopeless, and how wicked it
      was to marry without affection.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the meeting with which she was threatened for the morrow was past,
      she could not but flatter herself that the subject would be finally
      concluded, and Mr. Crawford once gone from Mansfield, that everything
      would soon be as if no such subject had existed. She would not, could not
      believe, that Mr. Crawford&rsquo;s affection for her could distress him long;
      his mind was not of that sort. London would soon bring its cure. In London
      he would soon learn to wonder at his infatuation, and be thankful for the
      right reason in her which had saved him from its evil consequences.
    </p>
    <p>
      While Fanny&rsquo;s mind was engaged in these sort of hopes, her uncle was, soon
      after tea, called out of the room; an occurrence too common to strike her,
      and she thought nothing of it till the butler reappeared ten minutes
      afterwards, and advancing decidedly towards herself, said, &ldquo;Sir Thomas
      wishes to speak with you, ma&rsquo;am, in his own room.&rdquo; Then it occurred to her
      what might be going on; a suspicion rushed over her mind which drove the
      colour from her cheeks; but instantly rising, she was preparing to obey,
      when Mrs. Norris called out, &ldquo;Stay, stay, Fanny! what are you about? where
      are you going? don&rsquo;t be in such a hurry. Depend upon it, it is not you who
      are wanted; depend upon it, it is me&rdquo; (looking at the butler); &ldquo;but you
      are so very eager to put yourself forward. What should Sir Thomas want you
      for? It is me, Baddeley, you mean; I am coming this moment. You mean me,
      Baddeley, I am sure; Sir Thomas wants me, not Miss Price.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Baddeley was stout. &ldquo;No, ma&rsquo;am, it is Miss Price; I am certain of its
      being Miss Price.&rdquo; And there was a half-smile with the words, which meant,
      &ldquo;I do not think you would answer the purpose at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Norris, much discontented, was obliged to compose herself to work
      again; and Fanny, walking off in agitating consciousness, found herself,
      as she anticipated, in another minute alone with Mr. Crawford.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      The conference was neither so short nor so conclusive as the lady had
      designed. The gentleman was not so easily satisfied. He had all the
      disposition to persevere that Sir Thomas could wish him. He had vanity,
      which strongly inclined him in the first place to think she did love him,
      though she might not know it herself; and which, secondly, when
      constrained at last to admit that she did know her own present feelings,
      convinced him that he should be able in time to make those feelings what
      he wished.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was in love, very much in love; and it was a love which, operating on
      an active, sanguine spirit, of more warmth than delicacy, made her
      affection appear of greater consequence because it was withheld, and
      determined him to have the glory, as well as the felicity, of forcing her
      to love him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He would not despair: he would not desist. He had every well-grounded
      reason for solid attachment; he knew her to have all the worth that could
      justify the warmest hopes of lasting happiness with her; her conduct at
      this very time, by speaking the disinterestedness and delicacy of her
      character (qualities which he believed most rare indeed), was of a sort to
      heighten all his wishes, and confirm all his resolutions. He knew not that
      he had a pre-engaged heart to attack. Of <i>that</i> he had no suspicion.
      He considered her rather as one who had never thought on the subject
      enough to be in danger; who had been guarded by youth, a youth of mind as
      lovely as of person; whose modesty had prevented her from understanding
      his attentions, and who was still overpowered by the suddenness of
      addresses so wholly unexpected, and the novelty of a situation which her
      fancy had never taken into account.
    </p>
    <p>
      Must it not follow of course, that, when he was understood, he should
      succeed? He believed it fully. Love such as his, in a man like himself,
      must with perseverance secure a return, and at no great distance; and he
      had so much delight in the idea of obliging her to love him in a very
      short time, that her not loving him now was scarcely regretted. A little
      difficulty to be overcome was no evil to Henry Crawford. He rather derived
      spirits from it. He had been apt to gain hearts too easily. His situation
      was new and animating.
    </p>
    <p>
      To Fanny, however, who had known too much opposition all her life to find
      any charm in it, all this was unintelligible. She found that he did mean
      to persevere; but how he could, after such language from her as she felt
      herself obliged to use, was not to be understood. She told him that she
      did not love him, could not love him, was sure she never should love him;
      that such a change was quite impossible; that the subject was most painful
      to her; that she must entreat him never to mention it again, to allow her
      to leave him at once, and let it be considered as concluded for ever. And
      when farther pressed, had added, that in her opinion their dispositions
      were so totally dissimilar as to make mutual affection incompatible; and
      that they were unfitted for each other by nature, education, and habit.
      All this she had said, and with the earnestness of sincerity; yet this was
      not enough, for he immediately denied there being anything uncongenial in
      their characters, or anything unfriendly in their situations; and
      positively declared, that he would still love, and still hope!
    </p>
    <p>
      Fanny knew her own meaning, but was no judge of her own manner. Her manner
      was incurably gentle; and she was not aware how much it concealed the
      sternness of her purpose. Her diffidence, gratitude, and softness made
      every expression of indifference seem almost an effort of self-denial;
      seem, at least, to be giving nearly as much pain to herself as to him. Mr.
      Crawford was no longer the Mr. Crawford who, as the clandestine,
      insidious, treacherous admirer of Maria Bertram, had been her abhorrence,
      whom she had hated to see or to speak to, in whom she could believe no
      good quality to exist, and whose power, even of being agreeable, she had
      barely acknowledged. He was now the Mr. Crawford who was addressing
      herself with ardent, disinterested love; whose feelings were apparently
      become all that was honourable and upright, whose views of happiness were
      all fixed on a marriage of attachment; who was pouring out his sense of
      her merits, describing and describing again his affection, proving as far
      as words could prove it, and in the language, tone, and spirit of a man of
      talent too, that he sought her for her gentleness and her goodness; and to
      complete the whole, he was now the Mr. Crawford who had procured William&rsquo;s
      promotion!
    </p>
    <p>
      Here was a change, and here were claims which could not but operate! She
      might have disdained him in all the dignity of angry virtue, in the
      grounds of Sotherton, or the theatre at Mansfield Park; but he approached
      her now with rights that demanded different treatment. She must be
      courteous, and she must be compassionate. She must have a sensation of
      being honoured, and whether thinking of herself or her brother, she must
      have a strong feeling of gratitude. The effect of the whole was a manner
      so pitying and agitated, and words intermingled with her refusal so
      expressive of obligation and concern, that to a temper of vanity and hope
      like Crawford&rsquo;s, the truth, or at least the strength of her indifference,
      might well be questionable; and he was not so irrational as Fanny
      considered him, in the professions of persevering, assiduous, and not
      desponding attachment which closed the interview.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was with reluctance that he suffered her to go; but there was no look
      of despair in parting to belie his words, or give her hopes of his being
      less unreasonable than he professed himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now she was angry. Some resentment did arise at a perseverance so selfish
      and ungenerous. Here was again a want of delicacy and regard for others
      which had formerly so struck and disgusted her. Here was again a something
      of the same Mr. Crawford whom she had so reprobated before. How evidently
      was there a gross want of feeling and humanity where his own pleasure was
      concerned; and alas! how always known no principle to supply as a duty
      what the heart was deficient in! Had her own affections been as free as
      perhaps they ought to have been, he never could have engaged them.
    </p>
    <p>
      So thought Fanny, in good truth and sober sadness, as she sat musing over
      that too great indulgence and luxury of a fire upstairs: wondering at the
      past and present; wondering at what was yet to come, and in a nervous
      agitation which made nothing clear to her but the persuasion of her being
      never under any circumstances able to love Mr. Crawford, and the felicity
      of having a fire to sit over and think of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Thomas was obliged, or obliged himself, to wait till the morrow for a
      knowledge of what had passed between the young people. He then saw Mr.
      Crawford, and received his account. The first feeling was disappointment:
      he had hoped better things; he had thought that an hour&rsquo;s entreaty from a
      young man like Crawford could not have worked so little change on a
      gentle-tempered girl like Fanny; but there was speedy comfort in the
      determined views and sanguine perseverance of the lover; and when seeing
      such confidence of success in the principal, Sir Thomas was soon able to
      depend on it himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing was omitted, on his side, of civility, compliment, or kindness,
      that might assist the plan. Mr. Crawford&rsquo;s steadiness was honoured, and
      Fanny was praised, and the connexion was still the most desirable in the
      world. At Mansfield Park Mr. Crawford would always be welcome; he had only
      to consult his own judgment and feelings as to the frequency of his
      visits, at present or in future. In all his niece&rsquo;s family and friends,
      there could be but one opinion, one wish on the subject; the influence of
      all who loved her must incline one way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everything was said that could encourage, every encouragement received
      with grateful joy, and the gentlemen parted the best of friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      Satisfied that the cause was now on a footing the most proper and hopeful,
      Sir Thomas resolved to abstain from all farther importunity with his
      niece, and to shew no open interference. Upon her disposition he believed
      kindness might be the best way of working. Entreaty should be from one
      quarter only. The forbearance of her family on a point, respecting which
      she could be in no doubt of their wishes, might be their surest means of
      forwarding it. Accordingly, on this principle, Sir Thomas took the first
      opportunity of saying to her, with a mild gravity, intended to be
      overcoming, &ldquo;Well, Fanny, I have seen Mr. Crawford again, and learn from
      him exactly how matters stand between you. He is a most extraordinary
      young man, and whatever be the event, you must feel that you have created
      an attachment of no common character; though, young as you are, and little
      acquainted with the transient, varying, unsteady nature of love, as it
      generally exists, you cannot be struck as I am with all that is wonderful
      in a perseverance of this sort against discouragement. With him it is
      entirely a matter of feeling: he claims no merit in it; perhaps is
      entitled to none. Yet, having chosen so well, his constancy has a
      respectable stamp. Had his choice been less unexceptionable, I should have
      condemned his persevering.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, sir,&rdquo; said Fanny, &ldquo;I am very sorry that Mr. Crawford should
      continue to know that it is paying me a very great compliment, and I feel
      most undeservedly honoured; but I am so perfectly convinced, and I have
      told him so, that it never will be in my power&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; interrupted Sir Thomas, &ldquo;there is no occasion for this. Your
      feelings are as well known to me as my wishes and regrets must be to you.
      There is nothing more to be said or done. From this hour the subject is
      never to be revived between us. You will have nothing to fear, or to be
      agitated about. You cannot suppose me capable of trying to persuade you to
      marry against your inclinations. Your happiness and advantage are all that
      I have in view, and nothing is required of you but to bear with Mr.
      Crawford&rsquo;s endeavours to convince you that they may not be incompatible
      with his. He proceeds at his own risk. You are on safe ground. I have
      engaged for your seeing him whenever he calls, as you might have done had
      nothing of this sort occurred. You will see him with the rest of us, in
      the same manner, and, as much as you can, dismissing the recollection of
      everything unpleasant. He leaves Northamptonshire so soon, that even this
      slight sacrifice cannot be often demanded. The future must be very
      uncertain. And now, my dear Fanny, this subject is closed between us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The promised departure was all that Fanny could think of with much
      satisfaction. Her uncle&rsquo;s kind expressions, however, and forbearing
      manner, were sensibly felt; and when she considered how much of the truth
      was unknown to him, she believed she had no right to wonder at the line of
      conduct he pursued. He, who had married a daughter to Mr. Rushworth:
      romantic delicacy was certainly not to be expected from him. She must do
      her duty, and trust that time might make her duty easier than it now was.
    </p>
    <p>
      She could not, though only eighteen, suppose Mr. Crawford&rsquo;s attachment
      would hold out for ever; she could not but imagine that steady, unceasing
      discouragement from herself would put an end to it in time. How much time
      she might, in her own fancy, allot for its dominion, is another concern.
      It would not be fair to inquire into a young lady&rsquo;s exact estimate of her
      own perfections.
    </p>
    <p>
      In spite of his intended silence, Sir Thomas found himself once more
      obliged to mention the subject to his niece, to prepare her briefly for
      its being imparted to her aunts; a measure which he would still have
      avoided, if possible, but which became necessary from the totally opposite
      feelings of Mr. Crawford as to any secrecy of proceeding. He had no idea
      of concealment. It was all known at the Parsonage, where he loved to talk
      over the future with both his sisters, and it would be rather gratifying
      to him to have enlightened witnesses of the progress of his success. When
      Sir Thomas understood this, he felt the necessity of making his own wife
      and sister-in-law acquainted with the business without delay; though, on
      Fanny&rsquo;s account, he almost dreaded the effect of the communication to Mrs.
      Norris as much as Fanny herself. He deprecated her mistaken but
      well-meaning zeal. Sir Thomas, indeed, was, by this time, not very far
      from classing Mrs. Norris as one of those well-meaning people who are
      always doing mistaken and very disagreeable things.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Norris, however, relieved him. He pressed for the strictest
      forbearance and silence towards their niece; she not only promised, but
      did observe it. She only looked her increased ill-will. Angry she was:
      bitterly angry; but she was more angry with Fanny for having received such
      an offer than for refusing it. It was an injury and affront to Julia, who
      ought to have been Mr. Crawford&rsquo;s choice; and, independently of that, she
      disliked Fanny, because she had neglected her; and she would have grudged
      such an elevation to one whom she had been always trying to depress.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Thomas gave her more credit for discretion on the occasion than she
      deserved; and Fanny could have blessed her for allowing her only to see
      her displeasure, and not to hear it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Bertram took it differently. She had been a beauty, and a prosperous
      beauty, all her life; and beauty and wealth were all that excited her
      respect. To know Fanny to be sought in marriage by a man of fortune,
      raised her, therefore, very much in her opinion. By convincing her that
      Fanny <i>was</i> very pretty, which she had been doubting about before,
      and that she would be advantageously married, it made her feel a sort of
      credit in calling her niece.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Fanny,&rdquo; said she, as soon as they were alone together afterwards,
      and she really had known something like impatience to be alone with her,
      and her countenance, as she spoke, had extraordinary animation; &ldquo;Well,
      Fanny, I have had a very agreeable surprise this morning. I must just
      speak of it <i>once</i>, I told Sir Thomas I must <i>once</i>, and then I
      shall have done. I give you joy, my dear niece.&rdquo; And looking at her
      complacently, she added, &ldquo;Humph, we certainly are a handsome family!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fanny coloured, and doubted at first what to say; when, hoping to assail
      her on her vulnerable side, she presently answered&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear aunt, <i>you</i> cannot wish me to do differently from what I
      have done, I am sure. <i>You</i> cannot wish me to marry; for you would
      miss me, should not you? Yes, I am sure you would miss me too much for
      that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, my dear, I should not think of missing you, when such an offer as
      this comes in your way. I could do very well without you, if you were
      married to a man of such good estate as Mr. Crawford. And you must be
      aware, Fanny, that it is every young woman&rsquo;s duty to accept such a very
      unexceptionable offer as this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was almost the only rule of conduct, the only piece of advice, which
      Fanny had ever received from her aunt in the course of eight years and a
      half. It silenced her. She felt how unprofitable contention would be. If
      her aunt&rsquo;s feelings were against her, nothing could be hoped from
      attacking her understanding. Lady Bertram was quite talkative.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will tell you what, Fanny,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I am sure he fell in love with
      you at the ball; I am sure the mischief was done that evening. You did
      look remarkably well. Everybody said so. Sir Thomas said so. And you know
      you had Chapman to help you to dress. I am very glad I sent Chapman to
      you. I shall tell Sir Thomas that I am sure it was done that evening.&rdquo; And
      still pursuing the same cheerful thoughts, she soon afterwards added, &ldquo;And I
      will tell you what, Fanny, which is more than I did for Maria: the next
      time Pug has a litter you shall have a puppy.&rdquo;

    </h2>
    <p>
      Edmund had great things to hear on his return. Many surprises were
      awaiting him. The first that occurred was not least in interest: the
      appearance of Henry Crawford and his sister walking together through the
      village as he rode into it. He had concluded&mdash;he had meant them to be
      far distant. His absence had been extended beyond a fortnight purposely to
      avoid Miss Crawford. He was returning to Mansfield with spirits ready to
      feed on melancholy remembrances, and tender associations, when her own
      fair self was before him, leaning on her brother&rsquo;s arm, and he found
      himself receiving a welcome, unquestionably friendly, from the woman whom,
      two moments before, he had been thinking of as seventy miles off, and as
      farther, much farther, from him in inclination than any distance could
      express.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her reception of him was of a sort which he could not have hoped for, had
      he expected to see her. Coming as he did from such a purport fulfilled as
      had taken him away, he would have expected anything rather than a look of
      satisfaction, and words of simple, pleasant meaning. It was enough to set
      his heart in a glow, and to bring him home in the properest state for
      feeling the full value of the other joyful surprises at hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      William&rsquo;s promotion, with all its particulars, he was soon master of; and
      with such a secret provision of comfort within his own breast to help the
      joy, he found in it a source of most gratifying sensation and unvarying
      cheerfulness all dinner-time.
    </p>
    <p>
      After dinner, when he and his father were alone, he had Fanny&rsquo;s history;
      and then all the great events of the last fortnight, and the present
      situation of matters at Mansfield were known to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fanny suspected what was going on. They sat so much longer than usual in
      the dining-parlour, that she was sure they must be talking of her; and
      when tea at last brought them away, and she was to be seen by Edmund
      again, she felt dreadfully guilty. He came to her, sat down by her, took
      her hand, and pressed it kindly; and at that moment she thought that, but
      for the occupation and the scene which the tea-things afforded, she must
      have betrayed her emotion in some unpardonable excess.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was not intending, however, by such action, to be conveying to her that
      unqualified approbation and encouragement which her hopes drew from it. It
      was designed only to express his participation in all that interested her,
      and to tell her that he had been hearing what quickened every feeling of
      affection. He was, in fact, entirely on his father&rsquo;s side of the question.
      His surprise was not so great as his father&rsquo;s at her refusing Crawford,
      because, so far from supposing her to consider him with anything like a
      preference, he had always believed it to be rather the reverse, and could
      imagine her to be taken perfectly unprepared, but Sir Thomas could not
      regard the connexion as more desirable than he did. It had every
      recommendation to him; and while honouring her for what she had done under
      the influence of her present indifference, honouring her in rather
      stronger terms than Sir Thomas could quite echo, he was most earnest in
      hoping, and sanguine in believing, that it would be a match at last, and
      that, united by mutual affection, it would appear that their dispositions
      were as exactly fitted to make them blessed in each other, as he was now
      beginning seriously to consider them. Crawford had been too precipitate.
      He had not given her time to attach herself. He had begun at the wrong
      end. With such powers as his, however, and such a disposition as hers,
      Edmund trusted that everything would work out a happy conclusion.
      Meanwhile, he saw enough of Fanny&rsquo;s embarrassment to make him scrupulously
      guard against exciting it a second time, by any word, or look, or
      movement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Crawford called the next day, and on the score of Edmund&rsquo;s return, Sir
      Thomas felt himself more than licensed to ask him to stay dinner; it was
      really a necessary compliment. He staid of course, and Edmund had then
      ample opportunity for observing how he sped with Fanny, and what degree of
      immediate encouragement for him might be extracted from her manners; and
      it was so little, so very, very little&mdash;every chance, every
      possibility of it, resting upon her embarrassment only; if there was not
      hope in her confusion, there was hope in nothing else&mdash;that he was
      almost ready to wonder at his friend&rsquo;s perseverance. Fanny was worth it
      all; he held her to be worth every effort of patience, every exertion of
      mind, but he did not think he could have gone on himself with any woman
      breathing, without something more to warm his courage than his eyes could
      discern in hers. He was very willing to hope that Crawford saw clearer,
      and this was the most comfortable conclusion for his friend that he could
      come to from all that he observed to pass before, and at, and after
      dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the evening a few circumstances occurred which he thought more
      promising. When he and Crawford walked into the drawing-room, his mother
      and Fanny were sitting as intently and silently at work as if there were
      nothing else to care for. Edmund could not help noticing their apparently
      deep tranquillity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have not been so silent all the time,&rdquo; replied his mother. &ldquo;Fanny has
      been reading to me, and only put the book down upon hearing you coming.&rdquo;
       And sure enough there was a book on the table which had the air of being
      very recently closed: a volume of Shakespeare. &ldquo;She often reads to me out
      of those books; and she was in the middle of a very fine speech of that
      man&rsquo;s&mdash;what&rsquo;s his name, Fanny?&mdash;when we heard your footsteps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Crawford took the volume. &ldquo;Let me have the pleasure of finishing that
      speech to your ladyship,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I shall find it immediately.&rdquo; And by
      carefully giving way to the inclination of the leaves, he did find it, or
      within a page or two, quite near enough to satisfy Lady Bertram, who
      assured him, as soon as he mentioned the name of Cardinal Wolsey, that he
      had got the very speech. Not a look or an offer of help had Fanny given;
      not a syllable for or against. All her attention was for her work. She
      seemed determined to be interested by nothing else. But taste was too
      strong in her. She could not abstract her mind five minutes: she was
      forced to listen; his reading was capital, and her pleasure in good
      reading extreme. To <i>good</i> reading, however, she had been long used:
      her uncle read well, her cousins all, Edmund very well, but in Mr.
      Crawford&rsquo;s reading there was a variety of excellence beyond what she had
      ever met with. The King, the Queen, Buckingham, Wolsey, Cromwell, all were
      given in turn; for with the happiest knack, the happiest power of jumping
      and guessing, he could always alight at will on the best scene, or the
      best speeches of each; and whether it were dignity, or pride, or
      tenderness, or remorse, or whatever were to be expressed, he could do it
      with equal beauty. It was truly dramatic. His acting had first taught
      Fanny what pleasure a play might give, and his reading brought all his
      acting before her again; nay, perhaps with greater enjoyment, for it came
      unexpectedly, and with no such drawback as she had been used to suffer in
      seeing him on the stage with Miss Bertram.
    </p>
    <p>
      Edmund watched the progress of her attention, and was amused and gratified
      by seeing how she gradually slackened in the needlework, which at the
      beginning seemed to occupy her totally: how it fell from her hand while
      she sat motionless over it, and at last, how the eyes which had appeared
      so studiously to avoid him throughout the day were turned and fixed on
      Crawford&mdash;fixed on him for minutes, fixed on him, in short, till the
      attraction drew Crawford&rsquo;s upon her, and the book was closed, and the
      charm was broken. Then she was shrinking again into herself, and blushing
      and working as hard as ever; but it had been enough to give Edmund
      encouragement for his friend, and as he cordially thanked him, he hoped to
      be expressing Fanny&rsquo;s secret feelings too.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That play must be a favourite with you,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;you read as if you
      knew it well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will be a favourite, I believe, from this hour,&rdquo; replied Crawford;
      &ldquo;but I do not think I have had a volume of Shakespeare in my hand before
      since I was fifteen. I once saw Henry the Eighth acted, or I have heard of
      it from somebody who did, I am not certain which. But Shakespeare one gets
      acquainted with without knowing how. It is a part of an Englishman&rsquo;s
      constitution. His thoughts and beauties are so spread abroad that one
      touches them everywhere; one is intimate with him by instinct. No man of
      any brain can open at a good part of one of his plays without falling into
      the flow of his meaning immediately.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No doubt one is familiar with Shakespeare in a degree,&rdquo; said Edmund,
      &ldquo;from one&rsquo;s earliest years. His celebrated passages are quoted by
      everybody; they are in half the books we open, and we all talk
      Shakespeare, use his similes, and describe with his descriptions; but this
      is totally distinct from giving his sense as you gave it. To know him in
      bits and scraps is common enough; to know him pretty thoroughly is,
      perhaps, not uncommon; but to read him well aloud is no everyday talent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir, you do me honour,&rdquo; was Crawford&rsquo;s answer, with a bow of mock
      gravity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both gentlemen had a glance at Fanny, to see if a word of accordant praise
      could be extorted from her; yet both feeling that it could not be. Her
      praise had been given in her attention; <i>that</i> must content them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Bertram&rsquo;s admiration was expressed, and strongly too. &ldquo;It was really
      like being at a play,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;I wish Sir Thomas had been here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Crawford was excessively pleased. If Lady Bertram, with all her
      incompetency and languor, could feel this, the inference of what her
      niece, alive and enlightened as she was, must feel, was elevating.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have a great turn for acting, I am sure, Mr. Crawford,&rdquo; said her
      ladyship soon afterwards; &ldquo;and I will tell you what, I think you will have
      a theatre, some time or other, at your house in Norfolk. I mean when you
      are settled there. I do indeed. I think you will fit up a theatre at your
      house in Norfolk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you, ma&rsquo;am?&rdquo; cried he, with quickness. &ldquo;No, no, that will never be.
      Your ladyship is quite mistaken. No theatre at Everingham! Oh no!&rdquo; And he
      looked at Fanny with an expressive smile, which evidently meant, &ldquo;That
      lady will never allow a theatre at Everingham.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Edmund saw it all, and saw Fanny so determined <i>not</i> to see it, as to
      make it clear that the voice was enough to convey the full meaning of the
      protestation; and such a quick consciousness of compliment, such a ready
      comprehension of a hint, he thought, was rather favourable than not.
    </p>
    <p>
      The subject of reading aloud was farther discussed. The two young men were
      the only talkers, but they, standing by the fire, talked over the too
      common neglect of the qualification, the total inattention to it, in the
      ordinary school-system for boys, the consequently natural, yet in some
      instances almost unnatural, degree of ignorance and uncouthness of men, of
      sensible and well-informed men, when suddenly called to the necessity of
      reading aloud, which had fallen within their notice, giving instances of
      blunders, and failures with their secondary causes, the want of management
      of the voice, of proper modulation and emphasis, of foresight and
      judgment, all proceeding from the first cause: want of early attention and
      habit; and Fanny was listening again with great entertainment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even in my profession,&rdquo; said Edmund, with a smile, &ldquo;how little the art of
      reading has been studied! how little a clear manner, and good delivery,
      have been attended to! I speak rather of the past, however, than the
      present. There is now a spirit of improvement abroad; but among those who
      were ordained twenty, thirty, forty years ago, the larger number, to judge
      by their performance, must have thought reading was reading, and preaching
      was preaching. It is different now. The subject is more justly considered.
      It is felt that distinctness and energy may have weight in recommending
      the most solid truths; and besides, there is more general observation and
      taste, a more critical knowledge diffused than formerly; in every
      congregation there is a larger proportion who know a little of the matter,
      and who can judge and criticise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Edmund had already gone through the service once since his ordination; and
      upon this being understood, he had a variety of questions from Crawford as
      to his feelings and success; questions, which being made, though with the
      vivacity of friendly interest and quick taste, without any touch of that
      spirit of banter or air of levity which Edmund knew to be most offensive
      to Fanny, he had true pleasure in satisfying; and when Crawford proceeded
      to ask his opinion and give his own as to the properest manner in which
      particular passages in the service should be delivered, shewing it to be a
      subject on which he had thought before, and thought with judgment, Edmund
      was still more and more pleased. This would be the way to Fanny&rsquo;s heart.
      She was not to be won by all that gallantry and wit and good-nature
      together could do; or, at least, she would not be won by them nearly so
      soon, without the assistance of sentiment and feeling, and seriousness on
      serious subjects.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our liturgy,&rdquo; observed Crawford, &ldquo;has beauties, which not even a
      careless, slovenly style of reading can destroy; but it has also
      redundancies and repetitions which require good reading not to be felt.
      For myself, at least, I must confess being not always so attentive as I
      ought to be&rdquo; (here was a glance at Fanny); &ldquo;that nineteen times out of
      twenty I am thinking how such a prayer ought to be read, and longing to
      have it to read myself. Did you speak?&rdquo; stepping eagerly to Fanny, and
      addressing her in a softened voice; and upon her saying &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he added,
      &ldquo;Are you sure you did not speak? I saw your lips move. I fancied you might
      be going to tell me I ought to be more attentive, and not <i>allow</i> my
      thoughts to wander. Are not you going to tell me so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, indeed, you know your duty too well for me to&mdash;even supposing&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stopt, felt herself getting into a puzzle, and could not be prevailed
      on to add another word, not by dint of several minutes of supplication and
      waiting. He then returned to his former station, and went on as if there
      had been no such tender interruption.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A sermon, well delivered, is more uncommon even than prayers well read. A
      sermon, good in itself, is no rare thing. It is more difficult to speak
      well than to compose well; that is, the rules and trick of composition are
      oftener an object of study. A thoroughly good sermon, thoroughly well
      delivered, is a capital gratification. I can never hear such a one without
      the greatest admiration and respect, and more than half a mind to take
      orders and preach myself. There is something in the eloquence of the
      pulpit, when it is really eloquence, which is entitled to the highest
      praise and honour. The preacher who can touch and affect such an
      heterogeneous mass of hearers, on subjects limited, and long worn
      threadbare in all common hands; who can say anything new or striking,
      anything that rouses the attention without offending the taste, or wearing
      out the feelings of his hearers, is a man whom one could not, in his
      public capacity, honour enough. I should like to be such a man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Edmund laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should indeed. I never listened to a distinguished preacher in my life
      without a sort of envy. But then, I must have a London audience. I could
      not preach but to the educated; to those who were capable of estimating my
      composition. And I do not know that I should be fond of preaching often;
      now and then, perhaps once or twice in the spring, after being anxiously
      expected for half a dozen Sundays together; but not for a constancy; it
      would not do for a constancy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here Fanny, who could not but listen, involuntarily shook her head, and
      Crawford was instantly by her side again, entreating to know her meaning;
      and as Edmund perceived, by his drawing in a chair, and sitting down close
      by her, that it was to be a very thorough attack, that looks and
      undertones were to be well tried, he sank as quietly as possible into a
      corner, turned his back, and took up a newspaper, very sincerely wishing
      that dear little Fanny might be persuaded into explaining away that shake
      of the head to the satisfaction of her ardent lover; and as earnestly
      trying to bury every sound of the business from himself in murmurs of his
      own, over the various advertisements of &ldquo;A most desirable Estate in South
      Wales&rdquo;; &ldquo;To Parents and Guardians&rdquo;; and a &ldquo;Capital season&rsquo;d Hunter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fanny, meanwhile, vexed with herself for not having been as motionless as
      she was speechless, and grieved to the heart to see Edmund&rsquo;s arrangements,
      was trying by everything in the power of her modest, gentle nature, to
      repulse Mr. Crawford, and avoid both his looks and inquiries; and he,
      unrepulsable, was persisting in both.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did that shake of the head mean?&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;What was it meant to
      express? Disapprobation, I fear. But of what? What had I been saying to
      displease you? Did you think me speaking improperly, lightly, irreverently
      on the subject? Only tell me if I was. Only tell me if I was wrong. I want
      to be set right. Nay, nay, I entreat you; for one moment put down your
      work. What did that shake of the head mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In vain was her &ldquo;Pray, sir, don&rsquo;t; pray, Mr. Crawford,&rdquo; repeated twice
      over; and in vain did she try to move away. In the same low, eager voice,
      and the same close neighbourhood, he went on, reurging the same questions
      as before. She grew more agitated and displeased.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can you, sir? You quite astonish me; I wonder how you can&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do I astonish you?&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Do you wonder? Is there anything in my
      present entreaty that you do not understand? I will explain to you
      instantly all that makes me urge you in this manner, all that gives me an
      interest in what you look and do, and excites my present curiosity. I will
      not leave you to wonder long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In spite of herself, she could not help half a smile, but she said
      nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shook your head at my acknowledging that I should not like to engage
      in the duties of a clergyman always for a constancy. Yes, that was the
      word. Constancy: I am not afraid of the word. I would spell it, read it,
      write it with anybody. I see nothing alarming in the word. Did you think I
      ought?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps, sir,&rdquo; said Fanny, wearied at last into speaking&mdash;&ldquo;perhaps,
      sir, I thought it was a pity you did not always know yourself as well as
      you seemed to do at that moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Crawford, delighted to get her to speak at any rate, was determined to
      keep it up; and poor Fanny, who had hoped to silence him by such an
      extremity of reproof, found herself sadly mistaken, and that it was only a
      change from one object of curiosity and one set of words to another. He
      had always something to entreat the explanation of. The opportunity was
      too fair. None such had occurred since his seeing her in her uncle&rsquo;s room,
      none such might occur again before his leaving Mansfield. Lady Bertram&rsquo;s
      being just on the other side of the table was a trifle, for she might
      always be considered as only half-awake, and Edmund&rsquo;s advertisements were
      still of the first utility.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Crawford, after a course of rapid questions and reluctant
      answers; &ldquo;I am happier than I was, because I now understand more clearly
      your opinion of me. You think me unsteady: easily swayed by the whim of
      the moment, easily tempted, easily put aside. With such an opinion, no
      wonder that. But we shall see. It is not by protestations that I shall
      endeavour to convince you I am wronged; it is not by telling you that my
      affections are steady. My conduct shall speak for me; absence, distance,
      time shall speak for me. <i>They</i> shall prove that, as far as you can
      be deserved by anybody, I do deserve you. You are infinitely my superior
      in merit; all <i>that</i> I know. You have qualities which I had not
      before supposed to exist in such a degree in any human creature. You have
      some touches of the angel in you beyond what&mdash;not merely beyond what
      one sees, because one never sees anything like it&mdash;but beyond what
      one fancies might be. But still I am not frightened. It is not by equality
      of merit that you can be won. That is out of the question. It is he who
      sees and worships your merit the strongest, who loves you most devotedly,
      that has the best right to a return. There I build my confidence. By that
      right I do and will deserve you; and when once convinced that my
      attachment is what I declare it, I know you too well not to entertain the
      warmest hopes. Yes, dearest, sweetest Fanny. Nay&rdquo; (seeing her draw back
      displeased), &ldquo;forgive me. Perhaps I have as yet no right; but by what
      other name can I call you? Do you suppose you are ever present to my
      imagination under any other? No, it is &lsquo;Fanny&rsquo; that I think of all day,
      and dream of all night. You have given the name such reality of sweetness,
      that nothing else can now be descriptive of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fanny could hardly have kept her seat any longer, or have refrained from
      at least trying to get away in spite of all the too public opposition she
      foresaw to it, had it not been for the sound of approaching relief, the
      very sound which she had been long watching for, and long thinking
      strangely delayed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The solemn procession, headed by Baddeley, of tea-board, urn, and
      cake-bearers, made its appearance, and delivered her from a grievous
      imprisonment of body and mind. Mr. Crawford was obliged to move. She was
      at liberty, she was busy, she was protected.
    </p>
    <p>
      Edmund was not sorry to be admitted again among the number of those who
      might speak and hear. But though the conference had seemed full long to
      him, and though on looking at Fanny he saw rather a flush of vexation, he
      inclined to hope that so much could not have been said and listened to
      without some profit to the speaker.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXV
    </h2>
    <p>
      Edmund had determined that it belonged entirely to Fanny to chuse whether
      her situation with regard to Crawford should be mentioned between them or
      not; and that if she did not lead the way, it should never be touched on
      by him; but after a day or two of mutual reserve, he was induced by his
      father to change his mind, and try what his influence might do for his
      friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      A day, and a very early day, was actually fixed for the Crawfords&rsquo; 
      departure; and Sir Thomas thought it might be as well to make one more
      effort for the young man before he left Mansfield, that all his
      professions and vows of unshaken attachment might have as much hope to
      sustain them as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Thomas was most cordially anxious for the perfection of Mr. Crawford&rsquo;s
      character in that point. He wished him to be a model of constancy; and
      fancied the best means of effecting it would be by not trying him too
      long.
    </p>
    <p>
      Edmund was not unwilling to be persuaded to engage in the business; he
      wanted to know Fanny&rsquo;s feelings. She had been used to consult him in every
      difficulty, and he loved her too well to bear to be denied her confidence
      now; he hoped to be of service to her, he thought he must be of service to
      her; whom else had she to open her heart to? If she did not need counsel,
      she must need the comfort of communication. Fanny estranged from him,
      silent and reserved, was an unnatural state of things; a state which he
      must break through, and which he could easily learn to think she was
      wanting him to break through.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will speak to her, sir: I will take the first opportunity of speaking
      to her alone,&rdquo; was the result of such thoughts as these; and upon Sir
      Thomas&rsquo;s information of her being at that very time walking alone in the
      shrubbery, he instantly joined her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am come to walk with you, Fanny,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Shall I?&rdquo; Drawing her arm
      within his. &ldquo;It is a long while since we have had a comfortable walk
      together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She assented to it all rather by look than word. Her spirits were low.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Fanny,&rdquo; he presently added, &ldquo;in order to have a comfortable walk,
      something more is necessary than merely pacing this gravel together. You
      must talk to me. I know you have something on your mind. I know what you
      are thinking of. You cannot suppose me uninformed. Am I to hear of it from
      everybody but Fanny herself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fanny, at once agitated and dejected, replied, &ldquo;If you hear of it from
      everybody, cousin, there can be nothing for me to tell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not of facts, perhaps; but of feelings, Fanny. No one but you can tell me
      them. I do not mean to press you, however. If it is not what you wish
      yourself, I have done. I had thought it might be a relief.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid we think too differently for me to find any relief in talking
      of what I feel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you suppose that we think differently? I have no idea of it. I dare
      say that, on a comparison of our opinions, they would be found as much
      alike as they have been used to be: to the point&mdash;I consider
      Crawford&rsquo;s proposals as most advantageous and desirable, if you could
      return his affection. I consider it as most natural that all your family
      should wish you could return it; but that, as you cannot, you have done
      exactly as you ought in refusing him. Can there be any disagreement
      between us here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh no! But I thought you blamed me. I thought you were against me. This
      is such a comfort!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This comfort you might have had sooner, Fanny, had you sought it. But how
      could you possibly suppose me against you? How could you imagine me an
      advocate for marriage without love? Were I even careless in general on
      such matters, how could you imagine me so where your happiness was at
      stake?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My uncle thought me wrong, and I knew he had been talking to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As far as you have gone, Fanny, I think you perfectly right. I may be
      sorry, I may be surprised&mdash;though hardly <i>that</i>, for you had not
      had time to attach yourself&mdash;but I think you perfectly right. Can it
      admit of a question? It is disgraceful to us if it does. You did not love
      him; nothing could have justified your accepting him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fanny had not felt so comfortable for days and days.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So far your conduct has been faultless, and they were quite mistaken who
      wished you to do otherwise. But the matter does not end here. Crawford&rsquo;s
      is no common attachment; he perseveres, with the hope of creating that
      regard which had not been created before. This, we know, must be a work of
      time. But&rdquo; (with an affectionate smile) &ldquo;let him succeed at last, Fanny,
      let him succeed at last. You have proved yourself upright and
      disinterested, prove yourself grateful and tender-hearted; and then you
      will be the perfect model of a woman which I have always believed you born
      for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! never, never, never! he never will succeed with me.&rdquo; And she spoke
      with a warmth which quite astonished Edmund, and which she blushed at the
      recollection of herself, when she saw his look, and heard him reply,
      &ldquo;Never! Fanny!&mdash;so very determined and positive! This is not like
      yourself, your rational self.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean,&rdquo; she cried, sorrowfully correcting herself, &ldquo;that I <i>think</i>
      I never shall, as far as the future can be answered for; I think I never
      shall return his regard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must hope better things. I am aware, more aware than Crawford can be,
      that the man who means to make you love him (you having due notice of his
      intentions) must have very uphill work, for there are all your early
      attachments and habits in battle array; and before he can get your heart
      for his own use he has to unfasten it from all the holds upon things
      animate and inanimate, which so many years&rsquo; growth have confirmed, and
      which are considerably tightened for the moment by the very idea of
      separation. I know that the apprehension of being forced to quit Mansfield
      will for a time be arming you against him. I wish he had not been obliged
      to tell you what he was trying for. I wish he had known you as well as I
      do, Fanny. Between us, I think we should have won you. My theoretical and
      his practical knowledge together could not have failed. He should have
      worked upon my plans. I must hope, however, that time, proving him (as I
      firmly believe it will) to deserve you by his steady affection, will give
      him his reward. I cannot suppose that you have not the <i>wish</i> to love
      him&mdash;the natural wish of gratitude. You must have some feeling of
      that sort. You must be sorry for your own indifference.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are so totally unlike,&rdquo; said Fanny, avoiding a direct answer, &ldquo;we are
      so very, very different in all our inclinations and ways, that I consider
      it as quite impossible we should ever be tolerably happy together, even if
      I <i>could</i> like him. There never were two people more dissimilar. We
      have not one taste in common. We should be miserable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are mistaken, Fanny. The dissimilarity is not so strong. You are
      quite enough alike. You <i>have</i> tastes in common. You have moral and
      literary tastes in common. You have both warm hearts and benevolent
      feelings; and, Fanny, who that heard him read, and saw you listen to
      Shakespeare the other night, will think you unfitted as companions? You
      forget yourself: there is a decided difference in your tempers, I allow.
      He is lively, you are serious; but so much the better: his spirits will
      support yours. It is your disposition to be easily dejected and to fancy
      difficulties greater than they are. His cheerfulness will counteract this.
      He sees difficulties nowhere: and his pleasantness and gaiety will be a
      constant support to you. Your being so far unlike, Fanny, does not in the
      smallest degree make against the probability of your happiness together:
      do not imagine it. I am myself convinced that it is rather a favourable
      circumstance. I am perfectly persuaded that the tempers had better be
      unlike: I mean unlike in the flow of the spirits, in the manners, in the
      inclination for much or little company, in the propensity to talk or to be
      silent, to be grave or to be gay. Some opposition here is, I am thoroughly
      convinced, friendly to matrimonial happiness. I exclude extremes, of
      course; and a very close resemblance in all those points would be the
      likeliest way to produce an extreme. A counteraction, gentle and
      continual, is the best safeguard of manners and conduct.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Full well could Fanny guess where his thoughts were now: Miss Crawford&rsquo;s
      power was all returning. He had been speaking of her cheerfully from the
      hour of his coming home. His avoiding her was quite at an end. He had
      dined at the Parsonage only the preceding day.
    </p>
    <p>
      After leaving him to his happier thoughts for some minutes, Fanny, feeling
      it due to herself, returned to Mr. Crawford, and said, &ldquo;It is not merely
      in <i>temper</i> that I consider him as totally unsuited to myself;
      though, in <i>that</i> respect, I think the difference between us too
      great, infinitely too great: his spirits often oppress me; but there is
      something in him which I object to still more. I must say, cousin, that I
      cannot approve his character. I have not thought well of him from the time
      of the play. I then saw him behaving, as it appeared to me, so very
      improperly and unfeelingly&mdash;I may speak of it now because it is all
      over&mdash;so improperly by poor Mr. Rushworth, not seeming to care how he
      exposed or hurt him, and paying attentions to my cousin Maria, which&mdash;in
      short, at the time of the play, I received an impression which will never
      be got over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Fanny,&rdquo; replied Edmund, scarcely hearing her to the end, &ldquo;let us
      not, any of us, be judged by what we appeared at that period of general
      folly. The time of the play is a time which I hate to recollect. Maria was
      wrong, Crawford was wrong, we were all wrong together; but none so wrong
      as myself. Compared with me, all the rest were blameless. I was playing
      the fool with my eyes open.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As a bystander,&rdquo; said Fanny, &ldquo;perhaps I saw more than you did; and I do
      think that Mr. Rushworth was sometimes very jealous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very possibly. No wonder. Nothing could be more improper than the whole
      business. I am shocked whenever I think that Maria could be capable of it;
      but, if she could undertake the part, we must not be surprised at the
      rest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Before the play, I am much mistaken if <i>Julia</i> did not think he was
      paying her attentions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Julia! I have heard before from some one of his being in love with Julia;
      but I could never see anything of it. And, Fanny, though I hope I do
      justice to my sisters&rsquo; good qualities, I think it very possible that they
      might, one or both, be more desirous of being admired by Crawford, and
      might shew that desire rather more unguardedly than was perfectly prudent.
      I can remember that they were evidently fond of his society; and with such
      encouragement, a man like Crawford, lively, and it may be, a little
      unthinking, might be led on to&mdash;there could be nothing very striking,
      because it is clear that he had no pretensions: his heart was reserved for
      you. And I must say, that its being for you has raised him inconceivably
      in my opinion. It does him the highest honour; it shews his proper
      estimation of the blessing of domestic happiness and pure attachment. It
      proves him unspoilt by his uncle. It proves him, in short, everything that
      I had been used to wish to believe him, and feared he was not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am persuaded that he does not think, as he ought, on serious subjects.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, rather, that he has not thought at all upon serious subjects, which
      I believe to be a good deal the case. How could it be otherwise, with such
      an education and adviser? Under the disadvantages, indeed, which both have
      had, is it not wonderful that they should be what they are? Crawford&rsquo;s <i>feelings</i>,
      I am ready to acknowledge, have hitherto been too much his guides.
      Happily, those feelings have generally been good. You will supply the
      rest; and a most fortunate man he is to attach himself to such a creature&mdash;to
      a woman who, firm as a rock in her own principles, has a gentleness of
      character so well adapted to recommend them. He has chosen his partner,
      indeed, with rare felicity. He will make you happy, Fanny; I know he will
      make you happy; but you will make him everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would not engage in such a charge,&rdquo; cried Fanny, in a shrinking accent;
      &ldquo;in such an office of high responsibility!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As usual, believing yourself unequal to anything! fancying everything too
      much for you! Well, though I may not be able to persuade you into
      different feelings, you will be persuaded into them, I trust. I confess
      myself sincerely anxious that you may. I have no common interest in
      Crawford&rsquo;s well-doing. Next to your happiness, Fanny, his has the first
      claim on me. You are aware of my having no common interest in Crawford.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fanny was too well aware of it to have anything to say; and they walked on
      together some fifty yards in mutual silence and abstraction. Edmund first
      began again&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was very much pleased by her manner of speaking of it yesterday,
      particularly pleased, because I had not depended upon her seeing
      everything in so just a light. I knew she was very fond of you; but yet I
      was afraid of her not estimating your worth to her brother quite as it
      deserved, and of her regretting that he had not rather fixed on some woman
      of distinction or fortune. I was afraid of the bias of those worldly
      maxims, which she has been too much used to hear. But it was very
      different. She spoke of you, Fanny, just as she ought. She desires the
      connexion as warmly as your uncle or myself. We had a long talk about it.
      I should not have mentioned the subject, though very anxious to know her
      sentiments; but I had not been in the room five minutes before she began
      introducing it with all that openness of heart, and sweet peculiarity of
      manner, that spirit and ingenuousness which are so much a part of herself.
      Mrs. Grant laughed at her for her rapidity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was Mrs. Grant in the room, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, when I reached the house I found the two sisters together by
      themselves; and when once we had begun, we had not done with you, Fanny,
      till Crawford and Dr. Grant came in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is above a week since I saw Miss Crawford.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, she laments it; yet owns it may have been best. You will see her,
      however, before she goes. She is very angry with you, Fanny; you must be
      prepared for that. She calls herself very angry, but you can imagine her
      anger. It is the regret and disappointment of a sister, who thinks her
      brother has a right to everything he may wish for, at the first moment.
      She is hurt, as you would be for William; but she loves and esteems you
      with all her heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew she would be very angry with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dearest Fanny,&rdquo; cried Edmund, pressing her arm closer to him, &ldquo;do not
      let the idea of her anger distress you. It is anger to be talked of rather
      than felt. Her heart is made for love and kindness, not for resentment. I
      wish you could have overheard her tribute of praise; I wish you could have
      seen her countenance, when she said that you <i>should</i> be Henry&rsquo;s
      wife. And I observed that she always spoke of you as &lsquo;Fanny,&rsquo; which she
      was never used to do; and it had a sound of most sisterly cordiality.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Mrs. Grant, did she say&mdash;did she speak; was she there all the
      time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, she was agreeing exactly with her sister. The surprise of your
      refusal, Fanny, seems to have been unbounded. That you could refuse such a
      man as Henry Crawford seems more than they can understand. I said what I
      could for you; but in good truth, as they stated the case&mdash;you must
      prove yourself to be in your senses as soon as you can by a different
      conduct; nothing else will satisfy them. But this is teasing you. I have
      done. Do not turn away from me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I <i>should</i> have thought,&rdquo; said Fanny, after a pause of recollection
      and exertion, &ldquo;that every woman must have felt the possibility of a man&rsquo;s
      not being approved, not being loved by some one of her sex at least, let
      him be ever so generally agreeable. Let him have all the perfections in
      the world, I think it ought not to be set down as certain that a man must
      be acceptable to every woman he may happen to like himself. But, even
      supposing it is so, allowing Mr. Crawford to have all the claims which his
      sisters think he has, how was I to be prepared to meet him with any
      feeling answerable to his own? He took me wholly by surprise. I had not an
      idea that his behaviour to me before had any meaning; and surely I was not
      to be teaching myself to like him only because he was taking what seemed
      very idle notice of me. In my situation, it would have been the extreme of
      vanity to be forming expectations on Mr. Crawford. I am sure his sisters,
      rating him as they do, must have thought it so, supposing he had meant
      nothing. How, then, was I to be&mdash;to be in love with him the moment he
      said he was with me? How was I to have an attachment at his service, as
      soon as it was asked for? His sisters should consider me as well as him.
      The higher his deserts, the more improper for me ever to have thought of
      him. And, and&mdash;we think very differently of the nature of women, if
      they can imagine a woman so very soon capable of returning an affection as
      this seems to imply.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear, dear Fanny, now I have the truth. I know this to be the truth;
      and most worthy of you are such feelings. I had attributed them to you
      before. I thought I could understand you. You have now given exactly the
      explanation which I ventured to make for you to your friend and Mrs.
      Grant, and they were both better satisfied, though your warm-hearted
      friend was still run away with a little by the enthusiasm of her fondness
      for Henry. I told them that you were of all human creatures the one over
      whom habit had most power and novelty least; and that the very
      circumstance of the novelty of Crawford&rsquo;s addresses was against him. Their
      being so new and so recent was all in their disfavour; that you could
      tolerate nothing that you were not used to; and a great deal more to the
      same purpose, to give them a knowledge of your character. Miss Crawford
      made us laugh by her plans of encouragement for her brother. She meant to
      urge him to persevere in the hope of being loved in time, and of having
      his addresses most kindly received at the end of about ten years&rsquo; happy
      marriage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fanny could with difficulty give the smile that was here asked for. Her
      feelings were all in revolt. She feared she had been doing wrong: saying
      too much, overacting the caution which she had been fancying necessary; in
      guarding against one evil, laying herself open to another; and to have
      Miss Crawford&rsquo;s liveliness repeated to her at such a moment, and on such a
      subject, was a bitter aggravation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Edmund saw weariness and distress in her face, and immediately resolved to
      forbear all farther discussion; and not even to mention the name of
      Crawford again, except as it might be connected with what <i>must</i> be
      agreeable to her. On this principle, he soon afterwards observed&mdash;&ldquo;They
      go on Monday. You are sure, therefore, of seeing your friend either
      to-morrow or Sunday. They really go on Monday; and I was within a trifle
      of being persuaded to stay at Lessingby till that very day! I had almost
      promised it. What a difference it might have made! Those five or six days
      more at Lessingby might have been felt all my life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were near staying there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very. I was most kindly pressed, and had nearly consented. Had I received
      any letter from Mansfield, to tell me how you were all going on, I believe
      I should certainly have staid; but I knew nothing that had happened here
      for a fortnight, and felt that I had been away long enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You spent your time pleasantly there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; that is, it was the fault of my own mind if I did not. They were all
      very pleasant. I doubt their finding me so. I took uneasiness with me, and
      there was no getting rid of it till I was in Mansfield again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Miss Owens&mdash;you liked them, did not you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, very well. Pleasant, good-humoured, unaffected girls. But I am
      spoilt, Fanny, for common female society. Good-humoured, unaffected girls
      will not do for a man who has been used to sensible women. They are two
      distinct orders of being. You and Miss Crawford have made me too nice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Still, however, Fanny was oppressed and wearied; he saw it in her looks,
      it could not be talked away; and attempting it no more, he led her
      directly, with the kind authority of a privileged guardian, into the
      house.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXVI
    </h2>
    <p>
      Edmund now believed himself perfectly acquainted with all that Fanny could
      tell, or could leave to be conjectured of her sentiments, and he was
      satisfied. It had been, as he before presumed, too hasty a measure on
      Crawford&rsquo;s side, and time must be given to make the idea first familiar,
      and then agreeable to her. She must be used to the consideration of his
      being in love with her, and then a return of affection might not be very
      distant.
    </p>
    <p>
      He gave this opinion as the result of the conversation to his father; and
      recommended there being nothing more said to her: no farther attempts to
      influence or persuade; but that everything should be left to Crawford&rsquo;s
      assiduities, and the natural workings of her own mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Thomas promised that it should be so. Edmund&rsquo;s account of Fanny&rsquo;s
      disposition he could believe to be just; he supposed she had all those
      feelings, but he must consider it as very unfortunate that she <i>had</i>;
      for, less willing than his son to trust to the future, he could not help
      fearing that if such very long allowances of time and habit were necessary
      for her, she might not have persuaded herself into receiving his addresses
      properly before the young man&rsquo;s inclination for paying them were over.
      There was nothing to be done, however, but to submit quietly and hope the
      best.
    </p>
    <p>
      The promised visit from &ldquo;her friend,&rdquo; as Edmund called Miss Crawford, was
      a formidable threat to Fanny, and she lived in continual terror of it. As
      a sister, so partial and so angry, and so little scrupulous of what she
      said, and in another light so triumphant and secure, she was in every way
      an object of painful alarm. Her displeasure, her penetration, and her
      happiness were all fearful to encounter; and the dependence of having
      others present when they met was Fanny&rsquo;s only support in looking forward
      to it. She absented herself as little as possible from Lady Bertram, kept
      away from the East room, and took no solitary walk in the shrubbery, in
      her caution to avoid any sudden attack.
    </p>
    <p>
      She succeeded. She was safe in the breakfast-room, with her aunt, when
      Miss Crawford did come; and the first misery over, and Miss Crawford
      looking and speaking with much less particularity of expression than she
      had anticipated, Fanny began to hope there would be nothing worse to be
      endured than a half-hour of moderate agitation. But here she hoped too
      much; Miss Crawford was not the slave of opportunity. She was determined
      to see Fanny alone, and therefore said to her tolerably soon, in a low
      voice, &ldquo;I must speak to you for a few minutes somewhere&rdquo;; words that Fanny
      felt all over her, in all her pulses and all her nerves. Denial was
      impossible. Her habits of ready submission, on the contrary, made her
      almost instantly rise and lead the way out of the room. She did it with
      wretched feelings, but it was inevitable.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were no sooner in the hall than all restraint of countenance was over
      on Miss Crawford&rsquo;s side. She immediately shook her head at Fanny with
      arch, yet affectionate reproach, and taking her hand, seemed hardly able
      to help beginning directly. She said nothing, however, but, &ldquo;Sad, sad
      girl! I do not know when I shall have done scolding you,&rdquo; and had
      discretion enough to reserve the rest till they might be secure of having
      four walls to themselves. Fanny naturally turned upstairs, and took her
      guest to the apartment which was now always fit for comfortable use;
      opening the door, however, with a most aching heart, and feeling that she
      had a more distressing scene before her than ever that spot had yet
      witnessed. But the evil ready to burst on her was at least delayed by the
      sudden change in Miss Crawford&rsquo;s ideas; by the strong effect on her mind
      which the finding herself in the East room again produced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; she cried, with instant animation, &ldquo;am I here again? The East room!
      Once only was I in this room before&rdquo;; and after stopping to look about
      her, and seemingly to retrace all that had then passed, she added, &ldquo;Once
      only before. Do you remember it? I came to rehearse. Your cousin came too;
      and we had a rehearsal. You were our audience and prompter. A delightful
      rehearsal. I shall never forget it. Here we were, just in this part of the
      room: here was your cousin, here was I, here were the chairs. Oh! why will
      such things ever pass away?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Happily for her companion, she wanted no answer. Her mind was entirely
      self-engrossed. She was in a reverie of sweet remembrances.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The scene we were rehearsing was so very remarkable! The subject of it so
      very&mdash;very&mdash;what shall I say? He was to be describing and
      recommending matrimony to me. I think I see him now, trying to be as
      demure and composed as Anhalt ought, through the two long speeches. &lsquo;When
      two sympathetic hearts meet in the marriage state, matrimony may be called
      a happy life.&rsquo; I suppose no time can ever wear out the impression I have
      of his looks and voice as he said those words. It was curious, very
      curious, that we should have such a scene to play! If I had the power of
      recalling any one week of my existence, it should be that week&mdash;that
      acting week. Say what you would, Fanny, it should be <i>that</i>; for I
      never knew such exquisite happiness in any other. His sturdy spirit to
      bend as it did! Oh! it was sweet beyond expression. But alas, that very
      evening destroyed it all. That very evening brought your most unwelcome
      uncle. Poor Sir Thomas, who was glad to see you? Yet, Fanny, do not
      imagine I would now speak disrespectfully of Sir Thomas, though I
      certainly did hate him for many a week. No, I do him justice now. He is
      just what the head of such a family should be. Nay, in sober sadness, I
      believe I now love you all.&rdquo; And having said so, with a degree of
      tenderness and consciousness which Fanny had never seen in her before, and
      now thought only too becoming, she turned away for a moment to recover
      herself. &ldquo;I have had a little fit since I came into this room, as you may
      perceive,&rdquo; said she presently, with a playful smile, &ldquo;but it is over now;
      so let us sit down and be comfortable; for as to scolding you, Fanny,
      which I came fully intending to do, I have not the heart for it when it
      comes to the point.&rdquo; And embracing her very affectionately, &ldquo;Good, gentle
      Fanny! when I think of this being the last time of seeing you for I do not
      know how long, I feel it quite impossible to do anything but love you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fanny was affected. She had not foreseen anything of this, and her
      feelings could seldom withstand the melancholy influence of the word
      &ldquo;last.&rdquo; She cried as if she had loved Miss Crawford more than she possibly
      could; and Miss Crawford, yet farther softened by the sight of such
      emotion, hung about her with fondness, and said, &ldquo;I hate to leave you. I
      shall see no one half so amiable where I am going. Who says we shall not
      be sisters? I know we shall. I feel that we are born to be connected; and
      those tears convince me that you feel it too, dear Fanny.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fanny roused herself, and replying only in part, said, &ldquo;But you are only
      going from one set of friends to another. You are going to a very
      particular friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, very true. Mrs. Fraser has been my intimate friend for years. But I
      have not the least inclination to go near her. I can think only of the
      friends I am leaving: my excellent sister, yourself, and the Bertrams in
      general. You have all so much more <i>heart</i> among you than one finds
      in the world at large. You all give me a feeling of being able to trust
      and confide in you, which in common intercourse one knows nothing of. I
      wish I had settled with Mrs. Fraser not to go to her till after Easter, a
      much better time for the visit, but now I cannot put her off. And when I
      have done with her I must go to her sister, Lady Stornaway, because <i>she</i>
      was rather my most particular friend of the two, but I have not cared much
      for <i>her</i> these three years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After this speech the two girls sat many minutes silent, each thoughtful:
      Fanny meditating on the different sorts of friendship in the world, Mary
      on something of less philosophic tendency. <i>She</i> first spoke again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How perfectly I remember my resolving to look for you upstairs, and
      setting off to find my way to the East room, without having an idea
      whereabouts it was! How well I remember what I was thinking of as I came
      along, and my looking in and seeing you here sitting at this table at
      work; and then your cousin&rsquo;s astonishment, when he opened the door, at
      seeing me here! To be sure, your uncle&rsquo;s returning that very evening!
      There never was anything quite like it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Another short fit of abstraction followed, when, shaking it off, she thus
      attacked her companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Fanny, you are absolutely in a reverie. Thinking, I hope, of one who
      is always thinking of you. Oh! that I could transport you for a short time
      into our circle in town, that you might understand how your power over
      Henry is thought of there! Oh! the envyings and heartburnings of dozens
      and dozens; the wonder, the incredulity that will be felt at hearing what
      you have done! For as to secrecy, Henry is quite the hero of an old
      romance, and glories in his chains. You should come to London to know how
      to estimate your conquest. If you were to see how he is courted, and how I
      am courted for his sake! Now, I am well aware that I shall not be half so
      welcome to Mrs. Fraser in consequence of his situation with you. When she
      comes to know the truth she will, very likely, wish me in Northamptonshire
      again; for there is a daughter of Mr. Fraser, by a first wife, whom she is
      wild to get married, and wants Henry to take. Oh! she has been trying for
      him to such a degree. Innocent and quiet as you sit here, you cannot have
      an idea of the <i>sensation</i> that you will be occasioning, of the
      curiosity there will be to see you, of the endless questions I shall have
      to answer! Poor Margaret Fraser will be at me for ever about your eyes and
      your teeth, and how you do your hair, and who makes your shoes. I wish
      Margaret were married, for my poor friend&rsquo;s sake, for I look upon the
      Frasers to be about as unhappy as most other married people. And yet it
      was a most desirable match for Janet at the time. We were all delighted.
      She could not do otherwise than accept him, for he was rich, and she had
      nothing; but he turns out ill-tempered and <i>exigeant</i>, and wants a
      young woman, a beautiful young woman of five-and-twenty, to be as steady
      as himself. And my friend does not manage him well; she does not seem to
      know how to make the best of it. There is a spirit of irritation which, to
      say nothing worse, is certainly very ill-bred. In their house I shall call
      to mind the conjugal manners of Mansfield Parsonage with respect. Even Dr.
      Grant does shew a thorough confidence in my sister, and a certain
      consideration for her judgment, which makes one feel there <i>is</i>
      attachment; but of that I shall see nothing with the Frasers. I shall be
      at Mansfield for ever, Fanny. My own sister as a wife, Sir Thomas Bertram
      as a husband, are my standards of perfection. Poor Janet has been sadly
      taken in, and yet there was nothing improper on her side: she did not run
      into the match inconsiderately; there was no want of foresight. She took
      three days to consider of his proposals, and during those three days asked
      the advice of everybody connected with her whose opinion was worth having,
      and especially applied to my late dear aunt, whose knowledge of the world
      made her judgment very generally and deservedly looked up to by all the
      young people of her acquaintance, and she was decidedly in favour of Mr.
      Fraser. This seems as if nothing were a security for matrimonial comfort.
      I have not so much to say for my friend Flora, who jilted a very nice
      young man in the Blues for the sake of that horrid Lord Stornaway, who has
      about as much sense, Fanny, as Mr. Rushworth, but much worse-looking, and
      with a blackguard character. I <i>had</i> my doubts at the time about her
      being right, for he has not even the air of a gentleman, and now I am sure
      she was wrong. By the bye, Flora Ross was dying for Henry the first winter
      she came out. But were I to attempt to tell you of all the women whom I
      have known to be in love with him, I should never have done. It is you,
      only you, insensible Fanny, who can think of him with anything like
      indifference. But are you so insensible as you profess yourself? No, no, I
      see you are not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was, indeed, so deep a blush over Fanny&rsquo;s face at that moment as
      might warrant strong suspicion in a predisposed mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excellent creature! I will not tease you. Everything shall take its
      course. But, dear Fanny, you must allow that you were not so absolutely
      unprepared to have the question asked as your cousin fancies. It is not
      possible but that you must have had some thoughts on the subject, some
      surmises as to what might be. You must have seen that he was trying to
      please you by every attention in his power. Was not he devoted to you at
      the ball? And then before the ball, the necklace! Oh! you received it just
      as it was meant. You were as conscious as heart could desire. I remember
      it perfectly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean, then, that your brother knew of the necklace beforehand? Oh!
      Miss Crawford, <i>that</i> was not fair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Knew of it! It was his own doing entirely, his own thought. I am ashamed
      to say that it had never entered my head, but I was delighted to act on
      his proposal for both your sakes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not say,&rdquo; replied Fanny, &ldquo;that I was not half afraid at the time
      of its being so, for there was something in your look that frightened me,
      but not at first; I was as unsuspicious of it at first&mdash;indeed,
      indeed I was. It is as true as that I sit here. And had I had an idea of
      it, nothing should have induced me to accept the necklace. As to your
      brother&rsquo;s behaviour, certainly I was sensible of a particularity: I had
      been sensible of it some little time, perhaps two or three weeks; but then
      I considered it as meaning nothing: I put it down as simply being his way,
      and was as far from supposing as from wishing him to have any serious
      thoughts of me. I had not, Miss Crawford, been an inattentive observer of
      what was passing between him and some part of this family in the summer
      and autumn. I was quiet, but I was not blind. I could not but see that Mr.
      Crawford allowed himself in gallantries which did mean nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! I cannot deny it. He has now and then been a sad flirt, and cared
      very little for the havoc he might be making in young ladies&rsquo; affections.
      I have often scolded him for it, but it is his only fault; and there is
      this to be said, that very few young ladies have any affections worth
      caring for. And then, Fanny, the glory of fixing one who has been shot at
      by so many; of having it in one&rsquo;s power to pay off the debts of one&rsquo;s sex!
      Oh! I am sure it is not in woman&rsquo;s nature to refuse such a triumph.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fanny shook her head. &ldquo;I cannot think well of a man who sports with any
      woman&rsquo;s feelings; and there may often be a great deal more suffered than a
      stander-by can judge of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not defend him. I leave him entirely to your mercy, and when he has
      got you at Everingham, I do not care how much you lecture him. But this I
      will say, that his fault, the liking to make girls a little in love with
      him, is not half so dangerous to a wife&rsquo;s happiness as a tendency to fall
      in love himself, which he has never been addicted to. And I do seriously
      and truly believe that he is attached to you in a way that he never was to
      any woman before; that he loves you with all his heart, and will love you
      as nearly for ever as possible. If any man ever loved a woman for ever, I
      think Henry will do as much for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fanny could not avoid a faint smile, but had nothing to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot imagine Henry ever to have been happier,&rdquo; continued Mary
      presently, &ldquo;than when he had succeeded in getting your brother&rsquo;s
      commission.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had made a sure push at Fanny&rsquo;s feelings here.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! yes. How very, very kind of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know he must have exerted himself very much, for I know the parties he
      had to move. The Admiral hates trouble, and scorns asking favours; and
      there are so many young men&rsquo;s claims to be attended to in the same way,
      that a friendship and energy, not very determined, is easily put by. What
      a happy creature William must be! I wish we could see him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Poor Fanny&rsquo;s mind was thrown into the most distressing of all its
      varieties. The recollection of what had been done for William was always
      the most powerful disturber of every decision against Mr. Crawford; and
      she sat thinking deeply of it till Mary, who had been first watching her
      complacently, and then musing on something else, suddenly called her
      attention by saying: &ldquo;I should like to sit talking with you here all day,
      but we must not forget the ladies below, and so good-bye, my dear, my
      amiable, my excellent Fanny, for though we shall nominally part in the
      breakfast-parlour, I must take leave of you here. And I do take leave,
      longing for a happy reunion, and trusting that when we meet again, it will
      be under circumstances which may open our hearts to each other without any
      remnant or shadow of reserve.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A very, very kind embrace, and some agitation of manner, accompanied these
      words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall see your cousin in town soon: he talks of being there tolerably
      soon; and Sir Thomas, I dare say, in the course of the spring; and your
      eldest cousin, and the Rushworths, and Julia, I am sure of meeting again
      and again, and all but you. I have two favours to ask, Fanny: one is your
      correspondence. You must write to me. And the other, that you will often
      call on Mrs. Grant, and make her amends for my being gone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The first, at least, of these favours Fanny would rather not have been
      asked; but it was impossible for her to refuse the correspondence; it was
      impossible for her even not to accede to it more readily than her own
      judgment authorised. There was no resisting so much apparent affection.
      Her disposition was peculiarly calculated to value a fond treatment, and
      from having hitherto known so little of it, she was the more overcome by
      Miss Crawford&rsquo;s. Besides, there was gratitude towards her, for having made
      their <i>tete-a-tete</i> so much less painful than her fears had
      predicted.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was over, and she had escaped without reproaches and without detection.
      Her secret was still her own; and while that was the case, she thought she
      could resign herself to almost everything.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the evening there was another parting. Henry Crawford came and sat some
      time with them; and her spirits not being previously in the strongest
      state, her heart was softened for a while towards him, because he really
      seemed to feel. Quite unlike his usual self, he scarcely said anything. He
      was evidently oppressed, and Fanny must grieve for him, though hoping she
      might never see him again till he were the husband of some other woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      When it came to the moment of parting, he would take her hand, he would
      not be denied it; he said nothing, however, or nothing that she heard, and
      when he had left the room, she was better pleased that such a token of
      friendship had passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the morrow the Crawfords were gone.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXVII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mr. Crawford gone, Sir Thomas&rsquo;s next object was that he should be missed;
      and he entertained great hope that his niece would find a blank in the
      loss of those attentions which at the time she had felt, or fancied, an
      evil. She had tasted of consequence in its most flattering form; and he
      did hope that the loss of it, the sinking again into nothing, would awaken
      very wholesome regrets in her mind. He watched her with this idea; but he
      could hardly tell with what success. He hardly knew whether there were any
      difference in her spirits or not. She was always so gentle and retiring
      that her emotions were beyond his discrimination. He did not understand
      her: he felt that he did not; and therefore applied to Edmund to tell him
      how she stood affected on the present occasion, and whether she were more
      or less happy than she had been.
    </p>
    <p>
      Edmund did not discern any symptoms of regret, and thought his father a
      little unreasonable in supposing the first three or four days could
      produce any.
    </p>
    <p>
      What chiefly surprised Edmund was, that Crawford&rsquo;s sister, the friend and
      companion who had been so much to her, should not be more visibly
      regretted. He wondered that Fanny spoke so seldom of <i>her</i>, and had
      so little voluntarily to say of her concern at this separation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alas! it was this sister, this friend and companion, who was now the chief
      bane of Fanny&rsquo;s comfort. If she could have believed Mary&rsquo;s future fate as
      unconnected with Mansfield as she was determined the brother&rsquo;s should be,
      if she could have hoped her return thither to be as distant as she was
      much inclined to think his, she would have been light of heart indeed; but
      the more she recollected and observed, the more deeply was she convinced
      that everything was now in a fairer train for Miss Crawford&rsquo;s marrying
      Edmund than it had ever been before. On his side the inclination was
      stronger, on hers less equivocal. His objections, the scruples of his
      integrity, seemed all done away, nobody could tell how; and the doubts and
      hesitations of her ambition were equally got over&mdash;and equally
      without apparent reason. It could only be imputed to increasing
      attachment. His good and her bad feelings yielded to love, and such love
      must unite them. He was to go to town as soon as some business relative to
      Thornton Lacey were completed&mdash;perhaps within a fortnight; he talked
      of going, he loved to talk of it; and when once with her again, Fanny
      could not doubt the rest. Her acceptance must be as certain as his offer;
      and yet there were bad feelings still remaining which made the prospect of
      it most sorrowful to her, independently, she believed, independently of
      self.
    </p>
    <p>
      In their very last conversation, Miss Crawford, in spite of some amiable
      sensations, and much personal kindness, had still been Miss Crawford;
      still shewn a mind led astray and bewildered, and without any suspicion of
      being so; darkened, yet fancying itself light. She might love, but she did
      not deserve Edmund by any other sentiment. Fanny believed there was
      scarcely a second feeling in common between them; and she may be forgiven
      by older sages for looking on the chance of Miss Crawford&rsquo;s future
      improvement as nearly desperate, for thinking that if Edmund&rsquo;s influence
      in this season of love had already done so little in clearing her
      judgment, and regulating her notions, his worth would be finally wasted on
      her even in years of matrimony.
    </p>
    <p>
      Experience might have hoped more for any young people so circumstanced,
      and impartiality would not have denied to Miss Crawford&rsquo;s nature that
      participation of the general nature of women which would lead her to adopt
      the opinions of the man she loved and respected as her own. But as such
      were Fanny&rsquo;s persuasions, she suffered very much from them, and could
      never speak of Miss Crawford without pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Thomas, meanwhile, went on with his own hopes and his own
      observations, still feeling a right, by all his knowledge of human nature,
      to expect to see the effect of the loss of power and consequence on his
      niece&rsquo;s spirits, and the past attentions of the lover producing a craving
      for their return; and he was soon afterwards able to account for his not
      yet completely and indubitably seeing all this, by the prospect of another
      visitor, whose approach he could allow to be quite enough to support the
      spirits he was watching. William had obtained a ten days&rsquo; leave of
      absence, to be given to Northamptonshire, and was coming, the happiest of
      lieutenants, because the latest made, to shew his happiness and describe
      his uniform.
    </p>
    <p>
      He came; and he would have been delighted to shew his uniform there too,
      had not cruel custom prohibited its appearance except on duty. So the
      uniform remained at Portsmouth, and Edmund conjectured that before Fanny
      had any chance of seeing it, all its own freshness and all the freshness
      of its wearer&rsquo;s feelings must be worn away. It would be sunk into a badge
      of disgrace; for what can be more unbecoming, or more worthless, than the
      uniform of a lieutenant, who has been a lieutenant a year or two, and sees
      others made commanders before him? So reasoned Edmund, till his father
      made him the confidant of a scheme which placed Fanny&rsquo;s chance of seeing
      the second lieutenant of H.M.S. Thrush in all his glory in another light.
    </p>
    <p>
      This scheme was that she should accompany her brother back to Portsmouth,
      and spend a little time with her own family. It had occurred to Sir
      Thomas, in one of his dignified musings, as a right and desirable measure;
      but before he absolutely made up his mind, he consulted his son. Edmund
      considered it every way, and saw nothing but what was right. The thing was
      good in itself, and could not be done at a better time; and he had no
      doubt of it being highly agreeable to Fanny. This was enough to determine
      Sir Thomas; and a decisive &ldquo;then so it shall be&rdquo; closed that stage of the
      business; Sir Thomas retiring from it with some feelings of satisfaction,
      and views of good over and above what he had communicated to his son; for
      his prime motive in sending her away had very little to do with the
      propriety of her seeing her parents again, and nothing at all with any
      idea of making her happy. He certainly wished her to go willingly, but he
      as certainly wished her to be heartily sick of home before her visit
      ended; and that a little abstinence from the elegancies and luxuries of
      Mansfield Park would bring her mind into a sober state, and incline her to
      a juster estimate of the value of that home of greater permanence, and
      equal comfort, of which she had the offer.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a medicinal project upon his niece&rsquo;s understanding, which he must
      consider as at present diseased. A residence of eight or nine years in the
      abode of wealth and plenty had a little disordered her powers of comparing
      and judging. Her father&rsquo;s house would, in all probability, teach her the
      value of a good income; and he trusted that she would be the wiser and
      happier woman, all her life, for the experiment he had devised.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had Fanny been at all addicted to raptures, she must have had a strong
      attack of them when she first understood what was intended, when her uncle
      first made her the offer of visiting the parents, and brothers, and
      sisters, from whom she had been divided almost half her life; of returning
      for a couple of months to the scenes of her infancy, with William for the
      protector and companion of her journey, and the certainty of continuing to
      see William to the last hour of his remaining on land. Had she ever given
      way to bursts of delight, it must have been then, for she was delighted,
      but her happiness was of a quiet, deep, heart-swelling sort; and though
      never a great talker, she was always more inclined to silence when feeling
      most strongly. At the moment she could only thank and accept. Afterwards,
      when familiarised with the visions of enjoyment so suddenly opened, she
      could speak more largely to William and Edmund of what she felt; but still
      there were emotions of tenderness that could not be clothed in words. The
      remembrance of all her earliest pleasures, and of what she had suffered in
      being torn from them, came over her with renewed strength, and it seemed
      as if to be at home again would heal every pain that had since grown out
      of the separation. To be in the centre of such a circle, loved by so many,
      and more loved by all than she had ever been before; to feel affection
      without fear or restraint; to feel herself the equal of those who
      surrounded her; to be at peace from all mention of the Crawfords, safe
      from every look which could be fancied a reproach on their account. This
      was a prospect to be dwelt on with a fondness that could be but half
      acknowledged.
    </p>
    <p>
      Edmund, too&mdash;to be two months from <i>him</i> (and perhaps she might
      be allowed to make her absence three) must do her good. At a distance,
      unassailed by his looks or his kindness, and safe from the perpetual
      irritation of knowing his heart, and striving to avoid his confidence, she
      should be able to reason herself into a properer state; she should be able
      to think of him as in London, and arranging everything there, without
      wretchedness. What might have been hard to bear at Mansfield was to become
      a slight evil at Portsmouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      The only drawback was the doubt of her aunt Bertram&rsquo;s being comfortable
      without her. She was of use to no one else; but <i>there</i> she might be
      missed to a degree that she did not like to think of; and that part of the
      arrangement was, indeed, the hardest for Sir Thomas to accomplish, and
      what only <i>he</i> could have accomplished at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he was master at Mansfield Park. When he had really resolved on any
      measure, he could always carry it through; and now by dint of long talking
      on the subject, explaining and dwelling on the duty of Fanny&rsquo;s sometimes
      seeing her family, he did induce his wife to let her go; obtaining it
      rather from submission, however, than conviction, for Lady Bertram was
      convinced of very little more than that Sir Thomas thought Fanny ought to
      go, and therefore that she must. In the calmness of her own dressing-room,
      in the impartial flow of her own meditations, unbiassed by his bewildering
      statements, she could not acknowledge any necessity for Fanny&rsquo;s ever going
      near a father and mother who had done without her so long, while she was
      so useful to herself. And as to the not missing her, which under Mrs.
      Norris&rsquo;s discussion was the point attempted to be proved, she set herself
      very steadily against admitting any such thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Thomas had appealed to her reason, conscience, and dignity. He called
      it a sacrifice, and demanded it of her goodness and self-command as such.
      But Mrs. Norris wanted to persuade her that Fanny could be very well
      spared&mdash;<i>she</i> being ready to give up all her own time to her as
      requested&mdash;and, in short, could not really be wanted or missed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That may be, sister,&rdquo; was all Lady Bertram&rsquo;s reply. &ldquo;I dare say you are
      very right; but I am sure I shall miss her very much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The next step was to communicate with Portsmouth. Fanny wrote to offer
      herself; and her mother&rsquo;s answer, though short, was so kind&mdash;a few
      simple lines expressed so natural and motherly a joy in the prospect of
      seeing her child again, as to confirm all the daughter&rsquo;s views of
      happiness in being with her&mdash;convincing her that she should now find
      a warm and affectionate friend in the &ldquo;mama&rdquo; who had certainly shewn no
      remarkable fondness for her formerly; but this she could easily suppose to
      have been her own fault or her own fancy. She had probably alienated love
      by the helplessness and fretfulness of a fearful temper, or been
      unreasonable in wanting a larger share than any one among so many could
      deserve. Now, when she knew better how to be useful, and how to forbear,
      and when her mother could be no longer occupied by the incessant demands
      of a house full of little children, there would be leisure and inclination
      for every comfort, and they should soon be what mother and daughter ought
      to be to each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      William was almost as happy in the plan as his sister. It would be the
      greatest pleasure to him to have her there to the last moment before he
      sailed, and perhaps find her there still when he came in from his first
      cruise. And besides, he wanted her so very much to see the Thrush before
      she went out of harbour&mdash;the Thrush was certainly the finest sloop in
      the service&mdash;and there were several improvements in the dockyard,
      too, which he quite longed to shew her.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not scruple to add that her being at home for a while would be a
      great advantage to everybody.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not know how it is,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;but we seem to want some of your nice
      ways and orderliness at my father&rsquo;s. The house is always in confusion. You
      will set things going in a better way, I am sure. You will tell my mother
      how it all ought to be, and you will be so useful to Susan, and you will
      teach Betsey, and make the boys love and mind you. How right and
      comfortable it will all be!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By the time Mrs. Price&rsquo;s answer arrived, there remained but a very few
      days more to be spent at Mansfield; and for part of one of those days the
      young travellers were in a good deal of alarm on the subject of their
      journey, for when the mode of it came to be talked of, and Mrs. Norris
      found that all her anxiety to save her brother-in-law&rsquo;s money was vain,
      and that in spite of her wishes and hints for a less expensive conveyance
      of Fanny, they were to travel post; when she saw Sir Thomas actually give
      William notes for the purpose, she was struck with the idea of there being
      room for a third in the carriage, and suddenly seized with a strong
      inclination to go with them, to go and see her poor dear sister Price. She
      proclaimed her thoughts. She must say that she had more than half a mind
      to go with the young people; it would be such an indulgence to her; she
      had not seen her poor dear sister Price for more than twenty years; and it
      would be a help to the young people in their journey to have her older
      head to manage for them; and she could not help thinking her poor dear
      sister Price would feel it very unkind of her not to come by such an
      opportunity.
    </p>
    <p>
      William and Fanny were horror-struck at the idea.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the comfort of their comfortable journey would be destroyed at once.
      With woeful countenances they looked at each other. Their suspense lasted
      an hour or two. No one interfered to encourage or dissuade. Mrs. Norris
      was left to settle the matter by herself; and it ended, to the infinite
      joy of her nephew and niece, in the recollection that she could not
      possibly be spared from Mansfield Park at present; that she was a great
      deal too necessary to Sir Thomas and Lady Bertram for her to be able to
      answer it to herself to leave them even for a week, and therefore must
      certainly sacrifice every other pleasure to that of being useful to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      It had, in fact, occurred to her, that though taken to Portsmouth for
      nothing, it would be hardly possible for her to avoid paying her own
      expenses back again. So her poor dear sister Price was left to all the
      disappointment of her missing such an opportunity, and another twenty
      years&rsquo; absence, perhaps, begun.
    </p>
    <p>
      Edmund&rsquo;s plans were affected by this Portsmouth journey, this absence of
      Fanny&rsquo;s. He too had a sacrifice to make to Mansfield Park as well as his
      aunt. He had intended, about this time, to be going to London; but he
      could not leave his father and mother just when everybody else of most
      importance to their comfort was leaving them; and with an effort, felt but
      not boasted of, he delayed for a week or two longer a journey which he was
      looking forward to with the hope of its fixing his happiness for ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      He told Fanny of it. She knew so much already, that she must know
      everything. It made the substance of one other confidential discourse
      about Miss Crawford; and Fanny was the more affected from feeling it to be
      the last time in which Miss Crawford&rsquo;s name would ever be mentioned
      between them with any remains of liberty. Once afterwards she was alluded
      to by him. Lady Bertram had been telling her niece in the evening to write
      to her soon and often, and promising to be a good correspondent herself;
      and Edmund, at a convenient moment, then added in a whisper, &ldquo;And <i>I</i>
      shall write to you, Fanny, when I have anything worth writing about,
      anything to say that I think you will like to hear, and that you will not
      hear so soon from any other quarter.&rdquo; Had she doubted his meaning while
      she listened, the glow in his face, when she looked up at him, would have
      been decisive.
    </p>
    <p>
      For this letter she must try to arm herself. That a letter from Edmund
      should be a subject of terror! She began to feel that she had not yet gone
      through all the changes of opinion and sentiment which the progress of
      time and variation of circumstances occasion in this world of changes. The
      vicissitudes of the human mind had not yet been exhausted by her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Fanny! though going as she did willingly and eagerly, the last
      evening at Mansfield Park must still be wretchedness. Her heart was
      completely sad at parting. She had tears for every room in the house, much
      more for every beloved inhabitant. She clung to her aunt, because she
      would miss her; she kissed the hand of her uncle with struggling sobs,
      because she had displeased him; and as for Edmund, she could neither
      speak, nor look, nor think, when the last moment came with <i>him</i>; and
      it was not till it was over that she knew he was giving her the
      affectionate farewell of a brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this passed overnight, for the journey was to begin very early in the
      morning; and when the small, diminished party met at breakfast, William
      and Fanny were talked of as already advanced one stage.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXVIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      The novelty of travelling, and the happiness of being with William, soon
      produced their natural effect on Fanny&rsquo;s spirits, when Mansfield Park was
      fairly left behind; and by the time their first stage was ended, and they
      were to quit Sir Thomas&rsquo;s carriage, she was able to take leave of the old
      coachman, and send back proper messages, with cheerful looks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of pleasant talk between the brother and sister there was no end.
      Everything supplied an amusement to the high glee of William&rsquo;s mind, and
      he was full of frolic and joke in the intervals of their higher-toned
      subjects, all of which ended, if they did not begin, in praise of the
      Thrush, conjectures how she would be employed, schemes for an action with
      some superior force, which (supposing the first lieutenant out of the way,
      and William was not very merciful to the first lieutenant) was to give
      himself the next step as soon as possible, or speculations upon
      prize-money, which was to be generously distributed at home, with only the
      reservation of enough to make the little cottage comfortable, in which he
      and Fanny were to pass all their middle and later life together.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fanny&rsquo;s immediate concerns, as far as they involved Mr. Crawford, made no
      part of their conversation. William knew what had passed, and from his
      heart lamented that his sister&rsquo;s feelings should be so cold towards a man
      whom he must consider as the first of human characters; but he was of an
      age to be all for love, and therefore unable to blame; and knowing her
      wish on the subject, he would not distress her by the slightest allusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had reason to suppose herself not yet forgotten by Mr. Crawford. She
      had heard repeatedly from his sister within the three weeks which had
      passed since their leaving Mansfield, and in each letter there had been a
      few lines from himself, warm and determined like his speeches. It was a
      correspondence which Fanny found quite as unpleasant as she had feared.
      Miss Crawford&rsquo;s style of writing, lively and affectionate, was itself an
      evil, independent of what she was thus forced into reading from the
      brother&rsquo;s pen, for Edmund would never rest till she had read the chief of
      the letter to him; and then she had to listen to his admiration of her
      language, and the warmth of her attachments. There had, in fact, been so
      much of message, of allusion, of recollection, so much of Mansfield in
      every letter, that Fanny could not but suppose it meant for him to hear;
      and to find herself forced into a purpose of that kind, compelled into a
      correspondence which was bringing her the addresses of the man she did not
      love, and obliging her to administer to the adverse passion of the man she
      did, was cruelly mortifying. Here, too, her present removal promised
      advantage. When no longer under the same roof with Edmund, she trusted
      that Miss Crawford would have no motive for writing strong enough to
      overcome the trouble, and that at Portsmouth their correspondence would
      dwindle into nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      With such thoughts as these, among ten hundred others, Fanny proceeded in
      her journey safely and cheerfully, and as expeditiously as could
      rationally be hoped in the dirty month of February. They entered Oxford,
      but she could take only a hasty glimpse of Edmund&rsquo;s college as they passed
      along, and made no stop anywhere till they reached Newbury, where a
      comfortable meal, uniting dinner and supper, wound up the enjoyments and
      fatigues of the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning saw them off again at an early hour; and with no events,
      and no delays, they regularly advanced, and were in the environs of
      Portsmouth while there was yet daylight for Fanny to look around her, and
      wonder at the new buildings. They passed the drawbridge, and entered the
      town; and the light was only beginning to fail as, guided by William&rsquo;s
      powerful voice, they were rattled into a narrow street, leading from the
      High Street, and drawn up before the door of a small house now inhabited
      by Mr. Price.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fanny was all agitation and flutter; all hope and apprehension. The moment
      they stopped, a trollopy-looking maidservant, seemingly in waiting for
      them at the door, stepped forward, and more intent on telling the news
      than giving them any help, immediately began with, &ldquo;The Thrush is gone out
      of harbour, please sir, and one of the officers has been here to&mdash;&rdquo;
       She was interrupted by a fine tall boy of eleven years old, who, rushing
      out of the house, pushed the maid aside, and while William was opening the
      chaise-door himself, called out, &ldquo;You are just in time. We have been
      looking for you this half-hour. The Thrush went out of harbour this
      morning. I saw her. It was a beautiful sight. And they think she will have
      her orders in a day or two. And Mr. Campbell was here at four o&rsquo;clock to
      ask for you: he has got one of the Thrush&rsquo;s boats, and is going off to her
      at six, and hoped you would be here in time to go with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A stare or two at Fanny, as William helped her out of the carriage, was
      all the voluntary notice which this brother bestowed; but he made no
      objection to her kissing him, though still entirely engaged in detailing
      farther particulars of the Thrush&rsquo;s going out of harbour, in which he had
      a strong right of interest, being to commence his career of seamanship in
      her at this very time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another moment and Fanny was in the narrow entrance-passage of the house,
      and in her mother&rsquo;s arms, who met her there with looks of true kindness,
      and with features which Fanny loved the more, because they brought her
      aunt Bertram&rsquo;s before her, and there were her two sisters: Susan, a
      well-grown fine girl of fourteen, and Betsey, the youngest of the family,
      about five&mdash;both glad to see her in their way, though with no
      advantage of manner in receiving her. But manner Fanny did not want. Would
      they but love her, she should be satisfied.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was then taken into a parlour, so small that her first conviction was
      of its being only a passage-room to something better, and she stood for a
      moment expecting to be invited on; but when she saw there was no other
      door, and that there were signs of habitation before her, she called back
      her thoughts, reproved herself, and grieved lest they should have been
      suspected. Her mother, however, could not stay long enough to suspect
      anything. She was gone again to the street-door, to welcome William. &ldquo;Oh!
      my dear William, how glad I am to see you. But have you heard about the
      Thrush? She is gone out of harbour already; three days before we had any
      thought of it; and I do not know what I am to do about Sam&rsquo;s things, they
      will never be ready in time; for she may have her orders to-morrow,
      perhaps. It takes me quite unawares. And now you must be off for Spithead
      too. Campbell has been here, quite in a worry about you; and now what
      shall we do? I thought to have had such a comfortable evening with you,
      and here everything comes upon me at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her son answered cheerfully, telling her that everything was always for
      the best; and making light of his own inconvenience in being obliged to
      hurry away so soon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be sure, I had much rather she had stayed in harbour, that I might
      have sat a few hours with you in comfort; but as there is a boat ashore, I
      had better go off at once, and there is no help for it. Whereabouts does
      the Thrush lay at Spithead? Near the Canopus? But no matter; here&rsquo;s Fanny
      in the parlour, and why should we stay in the passage? Come, mother, you
      have hardly looked at your own dear Fanny yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In they both came, and Mrs. Price having kindly kissed her daughter again,
      and commented a little on her growth, began with very natural solicitude
      to feel for their fatigues and wants as travellers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor dears! how tired you must both be! and now, what will you have? I
      began to think you would never come. Betsey and I have been watching for
      you this half-hour. And when did you get anything to eat? And what would
      you like to have now? I could not tell whether you would be for some meat,
      or only a dish of tea, after your journey, or else I would have got
      something ready. And now I am afraid Campbell will be here before there is
      time to dress a steak, and we have no butcher at hand. It is very
      inconvenient to have no butcher in the street. We were better off in our
      last house. Perhaps you would like some tea as soon as it can be got.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They both declared they should prefer it to anything. &ldquo;Then, Betsey, my
      dear, run into the kitchen and see if Rebecca has put the water on; and
      tell her to bring in the tea-things as soon as she can. I wish we could
      get the bell mended; but Betsey is a very handy little messenger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Betsey went with alacrity, proud to shew her abilities before her fine new
      sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear me!&rdquo; continued the anxious mother, &ldquo;what a sad fire we have got, and
      I dare say you are both starved with cold. Draw your chair nearer, my
      dear. I cannot think what Rebecca has been about. I am sure I told her to
      bring some coals half an hour ago. Susan, you should have taken care of
      the fire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was upstairs, mama, moving my things,&rdquo; said Susan, in a fearless,
      self-defending tone, which startled Fanny. &ldquo;You know you had but just
      settled that my sister Fanny and I should have the other room; and I could
      not get Rebecca to give me any help.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Farther discussion was prevented by various bustles: first, the driver
      came to be paid; then there was a squabble between Sam and Rebecca about
      the manner of carrying up his sister&rsquo;s trunk, which he would manage all
      his own way; and lastly, in walked Mr. Price himself, his own loud voice
      preceding him, as with something of the oath kind he kicked away his son&rsquo;s
      port-manteau and his daughter&rsquo;s bandbox in the passage, and called out for
      a candle; no candle was brought, however, and he walked into the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fanny with doubting feelings had risen to meet him, but sank down again on
      finding herself undistinguished in the dusk, and unthought of. With a
      friendly shake of his son&rsquo;s hand, and an eager voice, he instantly began&mdash;&ldquo;Ha!
      welcome back, my boy. Glad to see you. Have you heard the news? The Thrush
      went out of harbour this morning. Sharp is the word, you see! By G&mdash;,
      you are just in time! The doctor has been here inquiring for you: he has
      got one of the boats, and is to be off for Spithead by six, so you had
      better go with him. I have been to Turner&rsquo;s about your mess; it is all in
      a way to be done. I should not wonder if you had your orders to-morrow:
      but you cannot sail with this wind, if you are to cruise to the westward;
      and Captain Walsh thinks you will certainly have a cruise to the westward,
      with the Elephant. By G&mdash;, I wish you may! But old Scholey was
      saying, just now, that he thought you would be sent first to the Texel.
      Well, well, we are ready, whatever happens. But by G&mdash;, you lost a
      fine sight by not being here in the morning to see the Thrush go out of
      harbour! I would not have been out of the way for a thousand pounds. Old
      Scholey ran in at breakfast-time, to say she had slipped her moorings and
      was coming out, I jumped up, and made but two steps to the platform. If
      ever there was a perfect beauty afloat, she is one; and there she lays at
      Spithead, and anybody in England would take her for an eight-and-twenty. I
      was upon the platform two hours this afternoon looking at her. She lays
      close to the Endymion, between her and the Cleopatra, just to the eastward
      of the sheer hulk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; cried William, &ldquo;<i>that&rsquo;s</i> just where I should have put her
      myself. It&rsquo;s the best berth at Spithead. But here is my sister, sir; here
      is Fanny,&rdquo; turning and leading her forward; &ldquo;it is so dark you do not see
      her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With an acknowledgment that he had quite forgot her, Mr. Price now
      received his daughter; and having given her a cordial hug, and observed
      that she was grown into a woman, and he supposed would be wanting a
      husband soon, seemed very much inclined to forget her again. Fanny shrunk
      back to her seat, with feelings sadly pained by his language and his smell
      of spirits; and he talked on only to his son, and only of the Thrush,
      though William, warmly interested as he was in that subject, more than
      once tried to make his father think of Fanny, and her long absence and
      long journey.
    </p>
    <p>
      After sitting some time longer, a candle was obtained; but as there was
      still no appearance of tea, nor, from Betsey&rsquo;s reports from the kitchen,
      much hope of any under a considerable period, William determined to go and
      change his dress, and make the necessary preparations for his removal on
      board directly, that he might have his tea in comfort afterwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he left the room, two rosy-faced boys, ragged and dirty, about eight
      and nine years old, rushed into it just released from school, and coming
      eagerly to see their sister, and tell that the Thrush was gone out of
      harbour; Tom and Charles. Charles had been born since Fanny&rsquo;s going away,
      but Tom she had often helped to nurse, and now felt a particular pleasure
      in seeing again. Both were kissed very tenderly, but Tom she wanted to
      keep by her, to try to trace the features of the baby she had loved, and
      talked to, of his infant preference of herself. Tom, however, had no mind
      for such treatment: he came home not to stand and be talked to, but to run
      about and make a noise; and both boys had soon burst from her, and slammed
      the parlour-door till her temples ached.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had now seen all that were at home; there remained only two brothers
      between herself and Susan, one of whom was a clerk in a public office in
      London, and the other midshipman on board an Indiaman. But though she had
      <i>seen</i> all the members of the family, she had not yet <i>heard</i>
      all the noise they could make. Another quarter of an hour brought her a
      great deal more. William was soon calling out from the landing-place of
      the second story for his mother and for Rebecca. He was in distress for
      something that he had left there, and did not find again. A key was
      mislaid, Betsey accused of having got at his new hat, and some slight, but
      essential alteration of his uniform waistcoat, which he had been promised
      to have done for him, entirely neglected.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Price, Rebecca, and Betsey all went up to defend themselves, all
      talking together, but Rebecca loudest, and the job was to be done as well
      as it could in a great hurry; William trying in vain to send Betsey down
      again, or keep her from being troublesome where she was; the whole of
      which, as almost every door in the house was open, could be plainly
      distinguished in the parlour, except when drowned at intervals by the
      superior noise of Sam, Tom, and Charles chasing each other up and down
      stairs, and tumbling about and hallooing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fanny was almost stunned. The smallness of the house and thinness of the
      walls brought everything so close to her, that, added to the fatigue of
      her journey, and all her recent agitation, she hardly knew how to bear it.
      <i>Within</i> the room all was tranquil enough, for Susan having
      disappeared with the others, there were soon only her father and herself
      remaining; and he, taking out a newspaper, the accustomary loan of a
      neighbour, applied himself to studying it, without seeming to recollect
      her existence. The solitary candle was held between himself and the paper,
      without any reference to her possible convenience; but she had nothing to
      do, and was glad to have the light screened from her aching head, as she
      sat in bewildered, broken, sorrowful contemplation.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was at home. But, alas! it was not such a home, she had not such a
      welcome, as&mdash;she checked herself; she was unreasonable. What right
      had she to be of importance to her family? She could have none, so long
      lost sight of! William&rsquo;s concerns must be dearest, they always had been,
      and he had every right. Yet to have so little said or asked about herself,
      to have scarcely an inquiry made after Mansfield! It did pain her to have
      Mansfield forgotten; the friends who had done so much&mdash;the dear, dear
      friends! But here, one subject swallowed up all the rest. Perhaps it must
      be so. The destination of the Thrush must be now preeminently interesting.
      A day or two might shew the difference. <i>She</i> only was to blame. Yet
      she thought it would not have been so at Mansfield. No, in her uncle&rsquo;s
      house there would have been a consideration of times and seasons, a
      regulation of subject, a propriety, an attention towards everybody which
      there was not here.
    </p>
    <p>
      The only interruption which thoughts like these received for nearly half
      an hour was from a sudden burst of her father&rsquo;s, not at all calculated to
      compose them. At a more than ordinary pitch of thumping and hallooing in
      the passage, he exclaimed, &ldquo;Devil take those young dogs! How they are
      singing out! Ay, Sam&rsquo;s voice louder than all the rest! That boy is fit for
      a boatswain. Holla, you there! Sam, stop your confounded pipe, or I shall
      be after you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This threat was so palpably disregarded, that though within five minutes
      afterwards the three boys all burst into the room together and sat down,
      Fanny could not consider it as a proof of anything more than their being
      for the time thoroughly fagged, which their hot faces and panting breaths
      seemed to prove, especially as they were still kicking each other&rsquo;s shins,
      and hallooing out at sudden starts immediately under their father&rsquo;s eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next opening of the door brought something more welcome: it was for
      the tea-things, which she had begun almost to despair of seeing that
      evening. Susan and an attendant girl, whose inferior appearance informed
      Fanny, to her great surprise, that she had previously seen the upper
      servant, brought in everything necessary for the meal; Susan looking, as
      she put the kettle on the fire and glanced at her sister, as if divided
      between the agreeable triumph of shewing her activity and usefulness, and
      the dread of being thought to demean herself by such an office. &ldquo;She had
      been into the kitchen,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;to hurry Sally and help make the toast,
      and spread the bread and butter, or she did not know when they should have
      got tea, and she was sure her sister must want something after her
      journey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fanny was very thankful. She could not but own that she should be very
      glad of a little tea, and Susan immediately set about making it, as if
      pleased to have the employment all to herself; and with only a little
      unnecessary bustle, and some few injudicious attempts at keeping her
      brothers in better order than she could, acquitted herself very well.
      Fanny&rsquo;s spirit was as much refreshed as her body; her head and heart were
      soon the better for such well-timed kindness. Susan had an open, sensible
      countenance; she was like William, and Fanny hoped to find her like him in
      disposition and goodwill towards herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this more placid state of things William reentered, followed not far
      behind by his mother and Betsey. He, complete in his lieutenant&rsquo;s uniform,
      looking and moving all the taller, firmer, and more graceful for it, and
      with the happiest smile over his face, walked up directly to Fanny, who,
      rising from her seat, looked at him for a moment in speechless admiration,
      and then threw her arms round his neck to sob out her various emotions of
      pain and pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anxious not to appear unhappy, she soon recovered herself; and wiping away
      her tears, was able to notice and admire all the striking parts of his
      dress; listening with reviving spirits to his cheerful hopes of being on
      shore some part of every day before they sailed, and even of getting her
      to Spithead to see the sloop.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next bustle brought in Mr. Campbell, the surgeon of the Thrush, a very
      well-behaved young man, who came to call for his friend, and for whom
      there was with some contrivance found a chair, and with some hasty washing
      of the young tea-maker&rsquo;s, a cup and saucer; and after another quarter of
      an hour of earnest talk between the gentlemen, noise rising upon noise,
      and bustle upon bustle, men and boys at last all in motion together, the
      moment came for setting off; everything was ready, William took leave, and
      all of them were gone; for the three boys, in spite of their mother&rsquo;s
      entreaty, determined to see their brother and Mr. Campbell to the
      sally-port; and Mr. Price walked off at the same time to carry back his
      neighbour&rsquo;s newspaper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Something like tranquillity might now be hoped for; and accordingly, when
      Rebecca had been prevailed on to carry away the tea-things, and Mrs. Price
      had walked about the room some time looking for a shirt-sleeve, which
      Betsey at last hunted out from a drawer in the kitchen, the small party of
      females were pretty well composed, and the mother having lamented again
      over the impossibility of getting Sam ready in time, was at leisure to
      think of her eldest daughter and the friends she had come from.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few inquiries began: but one of the earliest&mdash;&ldquo;How did sister
      Bertram manage about her servants?&rdquo; &ldquo;Was she as much plagued as herself to
      get tolerable servants?&rdquo;&mdash;soon led her mind away from
      Northamptonshire, and fixed it on her own domestic grievances, and the
      shocking character of all the Portsmouth servants, of whom she believed
      her own two were the very worst, engrossed her completely. The Bertrams
      were all forgotten in detailing the faults of Rebecca, against whom Susan
      had also much to depose, and little Betsey a great deal more, and who did
      seem so thoroughly without a single recommendation, that Fanny could not
      help modestly presuming that her mother meant to part with her when her
      year was up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her year!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Price; &ldquo;I am sure I hope I shall be rid of her
      before she has staid a year, for that will not be up till November.
      Servants are come to such a pass, my dear, in Portsmouth, that it is quite
      a miracle if one keeps them more than half a year. I have no hope of ever
      being settled; and if I was to part with Rebecca, I should only get
      something worse. And yet I do not think I am a very difficult mistress to
      please; and I am sure the place is easy enough, for there is always a girl
      under her, and I often do half the work myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fanny was silent; but not from being convinced that there might not be a
      remedy found for some of these evils. As she now sat looking at Betsey,
      she could not but think particularly of another sister, a very pretty
      little girl, whom she had left there not much younger when she went into
      Northamptonshire, who had died a few years afterwards. There had been
      something remarkably amiable about her. Fanny in those early days had
      preferred her to Susan; and when the news of her death had at last reached
      Mansfield, had for a short time been quite afflicted. The sight of Betsey
      brought the image of little Mary back again, but she would not have pained
      her mother by alluding to her for the world. While considering her with
      these ideas, Betsey, at a small distance, was holding out something to
      catch her eyes, meaning to screen it at the same time from Susan&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have you got there, my love?&rdquo; said Fanny; &ldquo;come and shew it to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was a silver knife. Up jumped Susan, claiming it as her own, and trying
      to get it away; but the child ran to her mother&rsquo;s protection, and Susan
      could only reproach, which she did very warmly, and evidently hoping to
      interest Fanny on her side. &ldquo;It was very hard that she was not to have her
      <i>own</i> knife; it was her own knife; little sister Mary had left it to
      her upon her deathbed, and she ought to have had it to keep herself long
      ago. But mama kept it from her, and was always letting Betsey get hold of
      it; and the end of it would be that Betsey would spoil it, and get it for
      her own, though mama had <i>promised</i> her that Betsey should not have
      it in her own hands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fanny was quite shocked. Every feeling of duty, honour, and tenderness was
      wounded by her sister&rsquo;s speech and her mother&rsquo;s reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Susan,&rdquo; cried Mrs. Price, in a complaining voice, &ldquo;now, how can you
      be so cross? You are always quarrelling about that knife. I wish you would
      not be so quarrelsome. Poor little Betsey; how cross Susan is to you! But
      you should not have taken it out, my dear, when I sent you to the drawer.
      You know I told you not to touch it, because Susan is so cross about it. I
      must hide it another time, Betsey. Poor Mary little thought it would be
      such a bone of contention when she gave it me to keep, only two hours
      before she died. Poor little soul! she could but just speak to be heard,
      and she said so prettily, &lsquo;Let sister Susan have my knife, mama, when I am
      dead and buried.&rsquo; Poor little dear! she was so fond of it, Fanny, that she
      would have it lay by her in bed, all through her illness. It was the gift
      of her good godmother, old Mrs. Admiral Maxwell, only six weeks before she
      was taken for death. Poor little sweet creature! Well, she was taken away
      from evil to come. My own Betsey&rdquo; (fondling her), &ldquo;<i>you</i> have not the
      luck of such a good godmother. Aunt Norris lives too far off to think of
      such little people as you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fanny had indeed nothing to convey from aunt Norris, but a message to say
      she hoped that her god-daughter was a good girl, and learnt her book.
      There had been at one moment a slight murmur in the drawing-room at
      Mansfield Park about sending her a prayer-book; but no second sound had
      been heard of such a purpose. Mrs. Norris, however, had gone home and
      taken down two old prayer-books of her husband with that idea; but, upon
      examination, the ardour of generosity went off. One was found to have too
      small a print for a child&rsquo;s eyes, and the other to be too cumbersome for
      her to carry about.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fanny, fatigued and fatigued again, was thankful to accept the first
      invitation of going to bed; and before Betsey had finished her cry at
      being allowed to sit up only one hour extraordinary in honour of sister,
      she was off, leaving all below in confusion and noise again; the boys
      begging for toasted cheese, her father calling out for his rum and water,
      and Rebecca never where she ought to be.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was nothing to raise her spirits in the confined and scantily
      furnished chamber that she was to share with Susan. The smallness of the
      rooms above and below, indeed, and the narrowness of the passage and
      staircase, struck her beyond her imagination. She soon learned to think
      with respect of her own little attic at Mansfield Park, in <i>that</i>
      house reckoned too small for anybody&rsquo;s comfort.

      CHAPTER XXXIX
    </h2>
    <p>
      Could Sir Thomas have seen all his niece&rsquo;s feelings, when she wrote her
      first letter to her aunt, he would not have despaired; for though a good
      night&rsquo;s rest, a pleasant morning, the hope of soon seeing William again,
      and the comparatively quiet state of the house, from Tom and Charles being
      gone to school, Sam on some project of his own, and her father on his
      usual lounges, enabled her to express herself cheerfully on the subject of
      home, there were still, to her own perfect consciousness, many drawbacks
      suppressed. Could he have seen only half that she felt before the end of a
      week, he would have thought Mr. Crawford sure of her, and been delighted
      with his own sagacity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before the week ended, it was all disappointment. In the first place,
      William was gone. The Thrush had had her orders, the wind had changed, and
      he was sailed within four days from their reaching Portsmouth; and during
      those days she had seen him only twice, in a short and hurried way, when
      he had come ashore on duty. There had been no free conversation, no walk
      on the ramparts, no visit to the dockyard, no acquaintance with the
      Thrush, nothing of all that they had planned and depended on. Everything
      in that quarter failed her, except William&rsquo;s affection. His last thought
      on leaving home was for her. He stepped back again to the door to say,
      &ldquo;Take care of Fanny, mother. She is tender, and not used to rough it like
      the rest of us. I charge you, take care of Fanny.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      William was gone: and the home he had left her in was, Fanny could not
      conceal it from herself, in almost every respect the very reverse of what
      she could have wished. It was the abode of noise, disorder, and
      impropriety. Nobody was in their right place, nothing was done as it ought
      to be. She could not respect her parents as she had hoped. On her father,
      her confidence had not been sanguine, but he was more negligent of his
      family, his habits were worse, and his manners coarser, than she had been
      prepared for. He did not want abilities but he had no curiosity, and no
      information beyond his profession; he read only the newspaper and the
      navy-list; he talked only of the dockyard, the harbour, Spithead, and the
      Motherbank; he swore and he drank, he was dirty and gross. She had never
      been able to recall anything approaching to tenderness in his former
      treatment of herself. There had remained only a general impression of
      roughness and loudness; and now he scarcely ever noticed her, but to make
      her the object of a coarse joke.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her disappointment in her mother was greater: <i>there</i> she had hoped
      much, and found almost nothing. Every flattering scheme of being of
      consequence to her soon fell to the ground. Mrs. Price was not unkind;
      but, instead of gaining on her affection and confidence, and becoming more
      and more dear, her daughter never met with greater kindness from her than
      on the first day of her arrival. The instinct of nature was soon
      satisfied, and Mrs. Price&rsquo;s attachment had no other source. Her heart and
      her time were already quite full; she had neither leisure nor affection to
      bestow on Fanny. Her daughters never had been much to her. She was fond of
      her sons, especially of William, but Betsey was the first of her girls
      whom she had ever much regarded. To her she was most injudiciously
      indulgent. William was her pride; Betsey her darling; and John, Richard,
      Sam, Tom, and Charles occupied all the rest of her maternal solicitude,
      alternately her worries and her comforts. These shared her heart: her time
      was given chiefly to her house and her servants. Her days were spent in a
      kind of slow bustle; all was busy without getting on, always behindhand
      and lamenting it, without altering her ways; wishing to be an economist,
      without contrivance or regularity; dissatisfied with her servants, without
      skill to make them better, and whether helping, or reprimanding, or
      indulging them, without any power of engaging their respect.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of her two sisters, Mrs. Price very much more resembled Lady Bertram than
      Mrs. Norris. She was a manager by necessity, without any of Mrs. Norris&rsquo;s
      inclination for it, or any of her activity. Her disposition was naturally
      easy and indolent, like Lady Bertram&rsquo;s; and a situation of similar
      affluence and do-nothingness would have been much more suited to her
      capacity than the exertions and self-denials of the one which her
      imprudent marriage had placed her in. She might have made just as good a
      woman of consequence as Lady Bertram, but Mrs. Norris would have been a
      more respectable mother of nine children on a small income.
    </p>
    <p>
      Much of all this Fanny could not but be sensible of. She might scruple to
      make use of the words, but she must and did feel that her mother was a
      partial, ill-judging parent, a dawdle, a slattern, who neither taught nor
      restrained her children, whose house was the scene of mismanagement and
      discomfort from beginning to end, and who had no talent, no conversation,
      no affection towards herself; no curiosity to know her better, no desire
      of her friendship, and no inclination for her company that could lessen
      her sense of such feelings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fanny was very anxious to be useful, and not to appear above her home, or
      in any way disqualified or disinclined, by her foreign education, from
      contributing her help to its comforts, and therefore set about working for
      Sam immediately; and by working early and late, with perseverance and
      great despatch, did so much that the boy was shipped off at last, with
      more than half his linen ready. She had great pleasure in feeling her
      usefulness, but could not conceive how they would have managed without
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sam, loud and overbearing as he was, she rather regretted when he went,
      for he was clever and intelligent, and glad to be employed in any errand
      in the town; and though spurning the remonstrances of Susan, given as they
      were, though very reasonable in themselves, with ill-timed and powerless
      warmth, was beginning to be influenced by Fanny&rsquo;s services and gentle
      persuasions; and she found that the best of the three younger ones was
      gone in him: Tom and Charles being at least as many years as they were his
      juniors distant from that age of feeling and reason, which might suggest
      the expediency of making friends, and of endeavouring to be less
      disagreeable. Their sister soon despaired of making the smallest
      impression on <i>them</i>; they were quite untameable by any means of
      address which she had spirits or time to attempt. Every afternoon brought
      a return of their riotous games all over the house; and she very early
      learned to sigh at the approach of Saturday&rsquo;s constant half-holiday.
    </p>
    <p>
      Betsey, too, a spoiled child, trained up to think the alphabet her
      greatest enemy, left to be with the servants at her pleasure, and then
      encouraged to report any evil of them, she was almost as ready to despair
      of being able to love or assist; and of Susan&rsquo;s temper she had many
      doubts. Her continual disagreements with her mother, her rash squabbles
      with Tom and Charles, and petulance with Betsey, were at least so
      distressing to Fanny that, though admitting they were by no means without
      provocation, she feared the disposition that could push them to such
      length must be far from amiable, and from affording any repose to herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was the home which was to put Mansfield out of her head, and teach
      her to think of her cousin Edmund with moderated feelings. On the
      contrary, she could think of nothing but Mansfield, its beloved inmates,
      its happy ways. Everything where she now was in full contrast to it. The
      elegance, propriety, regularity, harmony, and perhaps, above all, the
      peace and tranquillity of Mansfield, were brought to her remembrance every
      hour of the day, by the prevalence of everything opposite to them <i>here</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The living in incessant noise was, to a frame and temper delicate and
      nervous like Fanny&rsquo;s, an evil which no superadded elegance or harmony
      could have entirely atoned for. It was the greatest misery of all. At
      Mansfield, no sounds of contention, no raised voice, no abrupt bursts, no
      tread of violence, was ever heard; all proceeded in a regular course of
      cheerful orderliness; everybody had their due importance; everybody&rsquo;s
      feelings were consulted. If tenderness could be ever supposed wanting,
      good sense and good breeding supplied its place; and as to the little
      irritations sometimes introduced by aunt Norris, they were short, they
      were trifling, they were as a drop of water to the ocean, compared with
      the ceaseless tumult of her present abode. Here everybody was noisy, every
      voice was loud (excepting, perhaps, her mother&rsquo;s, which resembled the soft
      monotony of Lady Bertram&rsquo;s, only worn into fretfulness). Whatever was
      wanted was hallooed for, and the servants hallooed out their excuses from
      the kitchen. The doors were in constant banging, the stairs were never at
      rest, nothing was done without a clatter, nobody sat still, and nobody
      could command attention when they spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a review of the two houses, as they appeared to her before the end of a
      week, Fanny was tempted to apply to them Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s celebrated judgment
      as to matrimony and celibacy, and say, that though Mansfield Park might
      have some pains, Portsmouth could have no pleasures.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XL
    </h2>
    <p>
      Fanny was right enough in not expecting to hear from Miss Crawford now at
      the rapid rate in which their correspondence had begun; Mary&rsquo;s next letter
      was after a decidedly longer interval than the last, but she was not right
      in supposing that such an interval would be felt a great relief to
      herself. Here was another strange revolution of mind! She was really glad
      to receive the letter when it did come. In her present exile from good
      society, and distance from everything that had been wont to interest her,
      a letter from one belonging to the set where her heart lived, written with
      affection, and some degree of elegance, was thoroughly acceptable. The
      usual plea of increasing engagements was made in excuse for not having
      written to her earlier; &ldquo;And now that I have begun,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;my
      letter will not be worth your reading, for there will be no little
      offering of love at the end, no three or four lines <i>passionnees</i>
      from the most devoted H. C. in the world, for Henry is in Norfolk;
      business called him to Everingham ten days ago, or perhaps he only
      pretended to call, for the sake of being travelling at the same time that
      you were. But there he is, and, by the bye, his absence may sufficiently
      account for any remissness of his sister&rsquo;s in writing, for there has been
      no &lsquo;Well, Mary, when do you write to Fanny? Is not it time for you to
      write to Fanny?&rsquo; to spur me on. At last, after various attempts at
      meeting, I have seen your cousins, &lsquo;dear Julia and dearest Mrs.
      Rushworth&rsquo;; they found me at home yesterday, and we were glad to see each
      other again. We <i>seemed</i> <i>very</i> glad to see each other, and I do
      really think we were a little. We had a vast deal to say. Shall I tell you
      how Mrs. Rushworth looked when your name was mentioned? I did not use to
      think her wanting in self-possession, but she had not quite enough for the
      demands of yesterday. Upon the whole, Julia was in the best looks of the
      two, at least after you were spoken of. There was no recovering the
      complexion from the moment that I spoke of &lsquo;Fanny,&rsquo; and spoke of her as a
      sister should. But Mrs. Rushworth&rsquo;s day of good looks will come; we have
      cards for her first party on the 28th. Then she will be in beauty, for she
      will open one of the best houses in Wimpole Street. I was in it two years
      ago, when it was Lady Lascelle&rsquo;s, and prefer it to almost any I know in
      London, and certainly she will then feel, to use a vulgar phrase, that she
      has got her pennyworth for her penny. Henry could not have afforded her
      such a house. I hope she will recollect it, and be satisfied, as well as
      she may, with moving the queen of a palace, though the king may appear
      best in the background; and as I have no desire to tease her, I shall
      never <i>force</i> your name upon her again. She will grow sober by
      degrees. From all that I hear and guess, Baron Wildenheim&rsquo;s attentions to
      Julia continue, but I do not know that he has any serious encouragement.
      She ought to do better. A poor honourable is no catch, and I cannot
      imagine any liking in the case, for take away his rants, and the poor
      baron has nothing. What a difference a vowel makes! If his rents were but
      equal to his rants! Your cousin Edmund moves slowly; detained, perchance,
      by parish duties. There may be some old woman at Thornton Lacey to be
      converted. I am unwilling to fancy myself neglected for a <i>young</i>
      one. Adieu! my dear sweet Fanny, this is a long letter from London: write
      me a pretty one in reply to gladden Henry&rsquo;s eyes, when he comes back, and
      send me an account of all the dashing young captains whom you disdain for
      his sake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was great food for meditation in this letter, and chiefly for
      unpleasant meditation; and yet, with all the uneasiness it supplied, it
      connected her with the absent, it told her of people and things about whom
      she had never felt so much curiosity as now, and she would have been glad
      to have been sure of such a letter every week. Her correspondence with her
      aunt Bertram was her only concern of higher interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for any society in Portsmouth, that could at all make amends for
      deficiencies at home, there were none within the circle of her father&rsquo;s
      and mother&rsquo;s acquaintance to afford her the smallest satisfaction: she saw
      nobody in whose favour she could wish to overcome her own shyness and
      reserve. The men appeared to her all coarse, the women all pert, everybody
      underbred; and she gave as little contentment as she received from
      introductions either to old or new acquaintance. The young ladies who
      approached her at first with some respect, in consideration of her coming
      from a baronet&rsquo;s family, were soon offended by what they termed &ldquo;airs&rdquo;;
      for, as she neither played on the pianoforte nor wore fine pelisses, they
      could, on farther observation, admit no right of superiority.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first solid consolation which Fanny received for the evils of home,
      the first which her judgment could entirely approve, and which gave any
      promise of durability, was in a better knowledge of Susan, and a hope of
      being of service to her. Susan had always behaved pleasantly to herself,
      but the determined character of her general manners had astonished and
      alarmed her, and it was at least a fortnight before she began to
      understand a disposition so totally different from her own. Susan saw that
      much was wrong at home, and wanted to set it right. That a girl of
      fourteen, acting only on her own unassisted reason, should err in the
      method of reform, was not wonderful; and Fanny soon became more disposed
      to admire the natural light of the mind which could so early distinguish
      justly, than to censure severely the faults of conduct to which it led.
      Susan was only acting on the same truths, and pursuing the same system,
      which her own judgment acknowledged, but which her more supine and
      yielding temper would have shrunk from asserting. Susan tried to be
      useful, where <i>she</i> could only have gone away and cried; and that
      Susan was useful she could perceive; that things, bad as they were, would
      have been worse but for such interposition, and that both her mother and
      Betsey were restrained from some excesses of very offensive indulgence and
      vulgarity.
    </p>
    <p>
      In every argument with her mother, Susan had in point of reason the
      advantage, and never was there any maternal tenderness to buy her off. The
      blind fondness which was for ever producing evil around her she had never
      known. There was no gratitude for affection past or present to make her
      better bear with its excesses to the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this became gradually evident, and gradually placed Susan before her
      sister as an object of mingled compassion and respect. That her manner was
      wrong, however, at times very wrong, her measures often ill-chosen and
      ill-timed, and her looks and language very often indefensible, Fanny could
      not cease to feel; but she began to hope they might be rectified. Susan,
      she found, looked up to her and wished for her good opinion; and new as
      anything like an office of authority was to Fanny, new as it was to
      imagine herself capable of guiding or informing any one, she did resolve
      to give occasional hints to Susan, and endeavour to exercise for her
      advantage the juster notions of what was due to everybody, and what would
      be wisest for herself, which her own more favoured education had fixed in
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her influence, or at least the consciousness and use of it, originated in
      an act of kindness by Susan, which, after many hesitations of delicacy,
      she at last worked herself up to. It had very early occurred to her that a
      small sum of money might, perhaps, restore peace for ever on the sore
      subject of the silver knife, canvassed as it now was continually, and the
      riches which she was in possession of herself, her uncle having given her
      &#163;10 at parting, made her as able as she was willing to be generous.
      But she was so wholly unused to confer favours, except on the very poor,
      so unpractised in removing evils, or bestowing kindnesses among her
      equals, and so fearful of appearing to elevate herself as a great lady at
      home, that it took some time to determine that it would not be unbecoming
      in her to make such a present. It was made, however, at last: a silver
      knife was bought for Betsey, and accepted with great delight, its newness
      giving it every advantage over the other that could be desired; Susan was
      established in the full possession of her own, Betsey handsomely declaring
      that now she had got one so much prettier herself, she should never want
      <i>that</i> again; and no reproach seemed conveyed to the equally
      satisfied mother, which Fanny had almost feared to be impossible. The deed
      thoroughly answered: a source of domestic altercation was entirely done
      away, and it was the means of opening Susan&rsquo;s heart to her, and giving her
      something more to love and be interested in. Susan shewed that she had
      delicacy: pleased as she was to be mistress of property which she had been
      struggling for at least two years, she yet feared that her sister&rsquo;s
      judgment had been against her, and that a reproof was designed her for
      having so struggled as to make the purchase necessary for the tranquillity
      of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her temper was open. She acknowledged her fears, blamed herself for having
      contended so warmly; and from that hour Fanny, understanding the worth of
      her disposition and perceiving how fully she was inclined to seek her good
      opinion and refer to her judgment, began to feel again the blessing of
      affection, and to entertain the hope of being useful to a mind so much in
      need of help, and so much deserving it. She gave advice, advice too sound
      to be resisted by a good understanding, and given so mildly and
      considerately as not to irritate an imperfect temper, and she had the
      happiness of observing its good effects not unfrequently. More was not
      expected by one who, while seeing all the obligation and expediency of
      submission and forbearance, saw also with sympathetic acuteness of feeling
      all that must be hourly grating to a girl like Susan. Her greatest wonder
      on the subject soon became&mdash;not that Susan should have been provoked
      into disrespect and impatience against her better knowledge&mdash;but that
      so much better knowledge, so many good notions should have been hers at
      all; and that, brought up in the midst of negligence and error, she should
      have formed such proper opinions of what ought to be; she, who had had no
      cousin Edmund to direct her thoughts or fix her principles.
    </p>
    <p>
      The intimacy thus begun between them was a material advantage to each. By
      sitting together upstairs, they avoided a great deal of the disturbance of
      the house; Fanny had peace, and Susan learned to think it no misfortune to
      be quietly employed. They sat without a fire; but that was a privation
      familiar even to Fanny, and she suffered the less because reminded by it
      of the East room. It was the only point of resemblance. In space, light,
      furniture, and prospect, there was nothing alike in the two apartments;
      and she often heaved a sigh at the remembrance of all her books and boxes,
      and various comforts there. By degrees the girls came to spend the chief
      of the morning upstairs, at first only in working and talking, but after a
      few days, the remembrance of the said books grew so potent and stimulative
      that Fanny found it impossible not to try for books again. There were none
      in her father&rsquo;s house; but wealth is luxurious and daring, and some of
      hers found its way to a circulating library. She became a subscriber;
      amazed at being anything <i>in propria persona</i>, amazed at her own
      doings in every way, to be a renter, a chuser of books! And to be having
      any one&rsquo;s improvement in view in her choice! But so it was. Susan had read
      nothing, and Fanny longed to give her a share in her own first pleasures,
      and inspire a taste for the biography and poetry which she delighted in
      herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this occupation she hoped, moreover, to bury some of the recollections
      of Mansfield, which were too apt to seize her mind if her fingers only
      were busy; and, especially at this time, hoped it might be useful in
      diverting her thoughts from pursuing Edmund to London, whither, on the
      authority of her aunt&rsquo;s last letter, she knew he was gone. She had no
      doubt of what would ensue. The promised notification was hanging over her
      head. The postman&rsquo;s knock within the neighbourhood was beginning to bring
      its daily terrors, and if reading could banish the idea for even half an
      hour, it was something gained.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XLI
    </h2>
    <p>
      A week was gone since Edmund might be supposed in town, and Fanny had
      heard nothing of him. There were three different conclusions to be drawn
      from his silence, between which her mind was in fluctuation; each of them
      at times being held the most probable. Either his going had been again
      delayed, or he had yet procured no opportunity of seeing Miss Crawford
      alone, or he was too happy for letter-writing!
    </p>
    <p>
      One morning, about this time, Fanny having now been nearly four weeks from
      Mansfield, a point which she never failed to think over and calculate
      every day, as she and Susan were preparing to remove, as usual, upstairs,
      they were stopped by the knock of a visitor, whom they felt they could not
      avoid, from Rebecca&rsquo;s alertness in going to the door, a duty which always
      interested her beyond any other.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a gentleman&rsquo;s voice; it was a voice that Fanny was just turning
      pale about, when Mr. Crawford walked into the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Good sense, like hers, will always act when really called upon; and she
      found that she had been able to name him to her mother, and recall her
      remembrance of the name, as that of &ldquo;William&rsquo;s friend,&rdquo; though she could
      not previously have believed herself capable of uttering a syllable at
      such a moment. The consciousness of his being known there only as
      William&rsquo;s friend was some support. Having introduced him, however, and
      being all reseated, the terrors that occurred of what this visit might
      lead to were overpowering, and she fancied herself on the point of
      fainting away.
    </p>
    <p>
      While trying to keep herself alive, their visitor, who had at first
      approached her with as animated a countenance as ever, was wisely and
      kindly keeping his eyes away, and giving her time to recover, while he
      devoted himself entirely to her mother, addressing her, and attending to
      her with the utmost politeness and propriety, at the same time with a
      degree of friendliness, of interest at least, which was making his manner
      perfect.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Price&rsquo;s manners were also at their best. Warmed by the sight of such
      a friend to her son, and regulated by the wish of appearing to advantage
      before him, she was overflowing with gratitude&mdash;artless, maternal
      gratitude&mdash;which could not be unpleasing. Mr. Price was out, which
      she regretted very much. Fanny was just recovered enough to feel that <i>she</i>
      could not regret it; for to her many other sources of uneasiness was added
      the severe one of shame for the home in which he found her. She might
      scold herself for the weakness, but there was no scolding it away. She was
      ashamed, and she would have been yet more ashamed of her father than of
      all the rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      They talked of William, a subject on which Mrs. Price could never tire;
      and Mr. Crawford was as warm in his commendation as even her heart could
      wish. She felt that she had never seen so agreeable a man in her life; and
      was only astonished to find that, so great and so agreeable as he was, he
      should be come down to Portsmouth neither on a visit to the port-admiral,
      nor the commissioner, nor yet with the intention of going over to the
      island, nor of seeing the dockyard. Nothing of all that she had been used
      to think of as the proof of importance, or the employment of wealth, had
      brought him to Portsmouth. He had reached it late the night before, was
      come for a day or two, was staying at the Crown, had accidentally met with
      a navy officer or two of his acquaintance since his arrival, but had no
      object of that kind in coming.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the time he had given all this information, it was not unreasonable to
      suppose that Fanny might be looked at and spoken to; and she was tolerably
      able to bear his eye, and hear that he had spent half an hour with his
      sister the evening before his leaving London; that she had sent her best
      and kindest love, but had had no time for writing; that he thought himself
      lucky in seeing Mary for even half an hour, having spent scarcely
      twenty-four hours in London, after his return from Norfolk, before he set
      off again; that her cousin Edmund was in town, had been in town, he
      understood, a few days; that he had not seen him himself, but that he was
      well, had left them all well at Mansfield, and was to dine, as yesterday,
      with the Frasers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fanny listened collectedly, even to the last-mentioned circumstance; nay,
      it seemed a relief to her worn mind to be at any certainty; and the words,
      &ldquo;then by this time it is all settled,&rdquo; passed internally, without more
      evidence of emotion than a faint blush.
    </p>
    <p>
      After talking a little more about Mansfield, a subject in which her
      interest was most apparent, Crawford began to hint at the expediency of an
      early walk. &ldquo;It was a lovely morning, and at that season of the year a
      fine morning so often turned off, that it was wisest for everybody not to
      delay their exercise&rdquo;; and such hints producing nothing, he soon proceeded
      to a positive recommendation to Mrs. Price and her daughters to take their
      walk without loss of time. Now they came to an understanding. Mrs. Price,
      it appeared, scarcely ever stirred out of doors, except of a Sunday; she
      owned she could seldom, with her large family, find time for a walk.
      &ldquo;Would she not, then, persuade her daughters to take advantage of such
      weather, and allow him the pleasure of attending them?&rdquo; Mrs. Price was
      greatly obliged and very complying. &ldquo;Her daughters were very much
      confined; Portsmouth was a sad place; they did not often get out; and she
      knew they had some errands in the town, which they would be very glad to
      do.&rdquo; And the consequence was, that Fanny, strange as it was&mdash;strange,
      awkward, and distressing&mdash;found herself and Susan, within ten
      minutes, walking towards the High Street with Mr. Crawford.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was soon pain upon pain, confusion upon confusion; for they were hardly
      in the High Street before they met her father, whose appearance was not
      the better from its being Saturday. He stopt; and, ungentlemanlike as he
      looked, Fanny was obliged to introduce him to Mr. Crawford. She could not
      have a doubt of the manner in which Mr. Crawford must be struck. He must
      be ashamed and disgusted altogether. He must soon give her up, and cease
      to have the smallest inclination for the match; and yet, though she had
      been so much wanting his affection to be cured, this was a sort of cure
      that would be almost as bad as the complaint; and I believe there is
      scarcely a young lady in the United Kingdoms who would not rather put up
      with the misfortune of being sought by a clever, agreeable man, than have
      him driven away by the vulgarity of her nearest relations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Crawford probably could not regard his future father-in-law with any
      idea of taking him for a model in dress; but (as Fanny instantly, and to
      her great relief, discerned) her father was a very different man, a very
      different Mr. Price in his behaviour to this most highly respected
      stranger, from what he was in his own family at home. His manners now,
      though not polished, were more than passable: they were grateful,
      animated, manly; his expressions were those of an attached father, and a
      sensible man; his loud tones did very well in the open air, and there was
      not a single oath to be heard. Such was his instinctive compliment to the
      good manners of Mr. Crawford; and, be the consequence what it might,
      Fanny&rsquo;s immediate feelings were infinitely soothed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The conclusion of the two gentlemen&rsquo;s civilities was an offer of Mr.
      Price&rsquo;s to take Mr. Crawford into the dockyard, which Mr. Crawford,
      desirous of accepting as a favour what was intended as such, though he had
      seen the dockyard again and again, and hoping to be so much the longer
      with Fanny, was very gratefully disposed to avail himself of, if the Miss
      Prices were not afraid of the fatigue; and as it was somehow or other
      ascertained, or inferred, or at least acted upon, that they were not at
      all afraid, to the dockyard they were all to go; and but for Mr. Crawford,
      Mr. Price would have turned thither directly, without the smallest
      consideration for his daughters&rsquo; errands in the High Street. He took care,
      however, that they should be allowed to go to the shops they came out
      expressly to visit; and it did not delay them long, for Fanny could so
      little bear to excite impatience, or be waited for, that before the
      gentlemen, as they stood at the door, could do more than begin upon the
      last naval regulations, or settle the number of three-deckers now in
      commission, their companions were ready to proceed.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were then to set forward for the dockyard at once, and the walk would
      have been conducted&mdash;according to Mr. Crawford&rsquo;s opinion&mdash;in a
      singular manner, had Mr. Price been allowed the entire regulation of it,
      as the two girls, he found, would have been left to follow, and keep up
      with them or not, as they could, while they walked on together at their
      own hasty pace. He was able to introduce some improvement occasionally,
      though by no means to the extent he wished; he absolutely would not walk
      away from them; and at any crossing or any crowd, when Mr. Price was only
      calling out, &ldquo;Come, girls; come, Fan; come, Sue, take care of yourselves;
      keep a sharp lookout!&rdquo; he would give them his particular attendance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once fairly in the dockyard, he began to reckon upon some happy
      intercourse with Fanny, as they were very soon joined by a brother lounger
      of Mr. Price&rsquo;s, who was come to take his daily survey of how things went
      on, and who must prove a far more worthy companion than himself; and after
      a time the two officers seemed very well satisfied going about together,
      and discussing matters of equal and never-failing interest, while the
      young people sat down upon some timbers in the yard, or found a seat on
      board a vessel in the stocks which they all went to look at. Fanny was
      most conveniently in want of rest. Crawford could not have wished her more
      fatigued or more ready to sit down; but he could have wished her sister
      away. A quick-looking girl of Susan&rsquo;s age was the very worst third in the
      world: totally different from Lady Bertram, all eyes and ears; and there
      was no introducing the main point before her. He must content himself with
      being only generally agreeable, and letting Susan have her share of
      entertainment, with the indulgence, now and then, of a look or hint for
      the better-informed and conscious Fanny. Norfolk was what he had mostly to
      talk of: there he had been some time, and everything there was rising in
      importance from his present schemes. Such a man could come from no place,
      no society, without importing something to amuse; his journeys and his
      acquaintance were all of use, and Susan was entertained in a way quite new
      to her. For Fanny, somewhat more was related than the accidental
      agreeableness of the parties he had been in. For her approbation, the
      particular reason of his going into Norfolk at all, at this unusual time
      of year, was given. It had been real business, relative to the renewal of
      a lease in which the welfare of a large and&mdash;he believed&mdash;industrious
      family was at stake. He had suspected his agent of some underhand dealing;
      of meaning to bias him against the deserving; and he had determined to go
      himself, and thoroughly investigate the merits of the case. He had gone,
      had done even more good than he had foreseen, had been useful to more than
      his first plan had comprehended, and was now able to congratulate himself
      upon it, and to feel that in performing a duty, he had secured agreeable
      recollections for his own mind. He had introduced himself to some tenants
      whom he had never seen before; he had begun making acquaintance with
      cottages whose very existence, though on his own estate, had been hitherto
      unknown to him. This was aimed, and well aimed, at Fanny. It was pleasing
      to hear him speak so properly; here he had been acting as he ought to do.
      To be the friend of the poor and the oppressed! Nothing could be more
      grateful to her; and she was on the point of giving him an approving look,
      when it was all frightened off by his adding a something too pointed of
      his hoping soon to have an assistant, a friend, a guide in every plan of
      utility or charity for Everingham: a somebody that would make Everingham
      and all about it a dearer object than it had ever been yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned away, and wished he would not say such things. She was willing
      to allow he might have more good qualities than she had been wont to
      suppose. She began to feel the possibility of his turning out well at
      last; but he was and must ever be completely unsuited to her, and ought
      not to think of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      He perceived that enough had been said of Everingham, and that it would be
      as well to talk of something else, and turned to Mansfield. He could not
      have chosen better; that was a topic to bring back her attention and her
      looks almost instantly. It was a real indulgence to her to hear or to
      speak of Mansfield. Now so long divided from everybody who knew the place,
      she felt it quite the voice of a friend when he mentioned it, and led the
      way to her fond exclamations in praise of its beauties and comforts, and
      by his honourable tribute to its inhabitants allowed her to gratify her
      own heart in the warmest eulogium, in speaking of her uncle as all that
      was clever and good, and her aunt as having the sweetest of all sweet
      tempers.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had a great attachment to Mansfield himself; he said so; he looked
      forward with the hope of spending much, very much, of his time there;
      always there, or in the neighbourhood. He particularly built upon a very
      happy summer and autumn there this year; he felt that it would be so: he
      depended upon it; a summer and autumn infinitely superior to the last. As
      animated, as diversified, as social, but with circumstances of superiority
      undescribable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mansfield, Sotherton, Thornton Lacey,&rdquo; he continued; &ldquo;what a society will
      be comprised in those houses! And at Michaelmas, perhaps, a fourth may be
      added: some small hunting-box in the vicinity of everything so dear; for
      as to any partnership in Thornton Lacey, as Edmund Bertram once
      good-humouredly proposed, I hope I foresee two objections: two fair,
      excellent, irresistible objections to that plan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fanny was doubly silenced here; though when the moment was passed, could
      regret that she had not forced herself into the acknowledged comprehension
      of one half of his meaning, and encouraged him to say something more of
      his sister and Edmund. It was a subject which she must learn to speak of,
      and the weakness that shrunk from it would soon be quite unpardonable.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Mr. Price and his friend had seen all that they wished, or had time
      for, the others were ready to return; and in the course of their walk
      back, Mr. Crawford contrived a minute&rsquo;s privacy for telling Fanny that his
      only business in Portsmouth was to see her; that he was come down for a
      couple of days on her account, and hers only, and because he could not
      endure a longer total separation. She was sorry, really sorry; and yet in
      spite of this and the two or three other things which she wished he had
      not said, she thought him altogether improved since she had seen him; he
      was much more gentle, obliging, and attentive to other people&rsquo;s feelings
      than he had ever been at Mansfield; she had never seen him so agreeable&mdash;so
      <i>near</i> being agreeable; his behaviour to her father could not offend,
      and there was something particularly kind and proper in the notice he took
      of Susan. He was decidedly improved. She wished the next day over, she
      wished he had come only for one day; but it was not so very bad as she
      would have expected: the pleasure of talking of Mansfield was so very
      great!
    </p>
    <p>
      Before they parted, she had to thank him for another pleasure, and one of
      no trivial kind. Her father asked him to do them the honour of taking his
      mutton with them, and Fanny had time for only one thrill of horror, before
      he declared himself prevented by a prior engagement. He was engaged to
      dinner already both for that day and the next; he had met with some
      acquaintance at the Crown who would not be denied; he should have the
      honour, however, of waiting on them again on the morrow, etc., and so they
      parted&mdash;Fanny in a state of actual felicity from escaping so horrible
      an evil!
    </p>
    <p>
      To have had him join their family dinner-party, and see all their
      deficiencies, would have been dreadful! Rebecca&rsquo;s cookery and Rebecca&rsquo;s
      waiting, and Betsey&rsquo;s eating at table without restraint, and pulling
      everything about as she chose, were what Fanny herself was not yet enough
      inured to for her often to make a tolerable meal. <i>She</i> was nice only
      from natural delicacy, but <i>he</i> had been brought up in a school of
      luxury and epicurism.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XLII
    </h2>
    <p>
      The Prices were just setting off for church the next day when Mr. Crawford
      appeared again. He came, not to stop, but to join them; he was asked to go
      with them to the Garrison chapel, which was exactly what he had intended,
      and they all walked thither together.
    </p>
    <p>
      The family were now seen to advantage. Nature had given them no
      inconsiderable share of beauty, and every Sunday dressed them in their
      cleanest skins and best attire. Sunday always brought this comfort to
      Fanny, and on this Sunday she felt it more than ever. Her poor mother now
      did not look so very unworthy of being Lady Bertram&rsquo;s sister as she was
      but too apt to look. It often grieved her to the heart to think of the
      contrast between them; to think that where nature had made so little
      difference, circumstances should have made so much, and that her mother,
      as handsome as Lady Bertram, and some years her junior, should have an
      appearance so much more worn and faded, so comfortless, so slatternly, so
      shabby. But Sunday made her a very creditable and tolerably
      cheerful-looking Mrs. Price, coming abroad with a fine family of children,
      feeling a little respite of her weekly cares, and only discomposed if she
      saw her boys run into danger, or Rebecca pass by with a flower in her hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      In chapel they were obliged to divide, but Mr. Crawford took care not to
      be divided from the female branch; and after chapel he still continued
      with them, and made one in the family party on the ramparts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Price took her weekly walk on the ramparts every fine Sunday
      throughout the year, always going directly after morning service and
      staying till dinner-time. It was her public place: there she met her
      acquaintance, heard a little news, talked over the badness of the
      Portsmouth servants, and wound up her spirits for the six days ensuing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thither they now went; Mr. Crawford most happy to consider the Miss Prices
      as his peculiar charge; and before they had been there long, somehow or
      other, there was no saying how, Fanny could not have believed it, but he
      was walking between them with an arm of each under his, and she did not
      know how to prevent or put an end to it. It made her uncomfortable for a
      time, but yet there were enjoyments in the day and in the view which would
      be felt.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day was uncommonly lovely. It was really March; but it was April in
      its mild air, brisk soft wind, and bright sun, occasionally clouded for a
      minute; and everything looked so beautiful under the influence of such a
      sky, the effects of the shadows pursuing each other on the ships at
      Spithead and the island beyond, with the ever-varying hues of the sea, now
      at high water, dancing in its glee and dashing against the ramparts with
      so fine a sound, produced altogether such a combination of charms for
      Fanny, as made her gradually almost careless of the circumstances under
      which she felt them. Nay, had she been without his arm, she would soon
      have known that she needed it, for she wanted strength for a two hours&rsquo; 
      saunter of this kind, coming, as it generally did, upon a week&rsquo;s previous
      inactivity. Fanny was beginning to feel the effect of being debarred from
      her usual regular exercise; she had lost ground as to health since her
      being in Portsmouth; and but for Mr. Crawford and the beauty of the
      weather would soon have been knocked up now.
    </p>
    <p>
      The loveliness of the day, and of the view, he felt like herself. They
      often stopt with the same sentiment and taste, leaning against the wall,
      some minutes, to look and admire; and considering he was not Edmund, Fanny
      could not but allow that he was sufficiently open to the charms of nature,
      and very well able to express his admiration. She had a few tender
      reveries now and then, which he could sometimes take advantage of to look
      in her face without detection; and the result of these looks was, that
      though as bewitching as ever, her face was less blooming than it ought to
      be. She <i>said</i> she was very well, and did not like to be supposed
      otherwise; but take it all in all, he was convinced that her present
      residence could not be comfortable, and therefore could not be salutary
      for her, and he was growing anxious for her being again at Mansfield,
      where her own happiness, and his in seeing her, must be so much greater.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have been here a month, I think?&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; not quite a month. It is only four weeks to-morrow since I left
      Mansfield.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a most accurate and honest reckoner. I should call that a month.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not arrive here till Tuesday evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And it is to be a two months&rsquo; visit, is not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. My uncle talked of two months. I suppose it will not be less.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how are you to be conveyed back again? Who comes for you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not know. I have heard nothing about it yet from my aunt. Perhaps I
      may be to stay longer. It may not be convenient for me to be fetched
      exactly at the two months&rsquo; end.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After a moment&rsquo;s reflection, Mr. Crawford replied, &ldquo;I know Mansfield, I
      know its way, I know its faults towards <i>you</i>. I know the danger of
      your being so far forgotten, as to have your comforts give way to the
      imaginary convenience of any single being in the family. I am aware that
      you may be left here week after week, if Sir Thomas cannot settle
      everything for coming himself, or sending your aunt&rsquo;s maid for you,
      without involving the slightest alteration of the arrangements which he
      may have laid down for the next quarter of a year. This will not do. Two
      months is an ample allowance; I should think six weeks quite enough. I am
      considering your sister&rsquo;s health,&rdquo; said he, addressing himself to Susan,
      &ldquo;which I think the confinement of Portsmouth unfavourable to. She requires
      constant air and exercise. When you know her as well as I do, I am sure
      you will agree that she does, and that she ought never to be long banished
      from the free air and liberty of the country. If, therefore&rdquo; (turning
      again to Fanny), &ldquo;you find yourself growing unwell, and any difficulties
      arise about your returning to Mansfield, without waiting for the two
      months to be ended, <i>that</i> must not be regarded as of any
      consequence, if you feel yourself at all less strong or comfortable than
      usual, and will only let my sister know it, give her only the slightest
      hint, she and I will immediately come down, and take you back to
      Mansfield. You know the ease and the pleasure with which this would be
      done. You know all that would be felt on the occasion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fanny thanked him, but tried to laugh it off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am perfectly serious,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;as you perfectly know. And I hope
      you will not be cruelly concealing any tendency to indisposition. Indeed,
      you shall <i>not</i>; it shall not be in your power; for so long only as
      you positively say, in every letter to Mary, &lsquo;I am well,&rsquo; and I know you
      cannot speak or write a falsehood, so long only shall you be considered as
      well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fanny thanked him again, but was affected and distressed to a degree that
      made it impossible for her to say much, or even to be certain of what she
      ought to say. This was towards the close of their walk. He attended them
      to the last, and left them only at the door of their own house, when he
      knew them to be going to dinner, and therefore pretended to be waited for
      elsewhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish you were not so tired,&rdquo; said he, still detaining Fanny after all
      the others were in the house&mdash;&ldquo;I wish I left you in stronger health.
      Is there anything I can do for you in town? I have half an idea of going
      into Norfolk again soon. I am not satisfied about Maddison. I am sure he
      still means to impose on me if possible, and get a cousin of his own into
      a certain mill, which I design for somebody else. I must come to an
      understanding with him. I must make him know that I will not be tricked on
      the south side of Everingham, any more than on the north: that I will be
      master of my own property. I was not explicit enough with him before. The
      mischief such a man does on an estate, both as to the credit of his
      employer and the welfare of the poor, is inconceivable. I have a great
      mind to go back into Norfolk directly, and put everything at once on such
      a footing as cannot be afterwards swerved from. Maddison is a clever
      fellow; I do not wish to displace him, provided he does not try to
      displace <i>me</i>; but it would be simple to be duped by a man who has no
      right of creditor to dupe me, and worse than simple to let him give me a
      hard-hearted, griping fellow for a tenant, instead of an honest man, to
      whom I have given half a promise already. Would it not be worse than
      simple? Shall I go? Do you advise it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I advise! You know very well what is right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. When you give me your opinion, I always know what is right. Your
      judgment is my rule of right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no! do not say so. We have all a better guide in ourselves, if we
      would attend to it, than any other person can be. Good-bye; I wish you a
      pleasant journey to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there nothing I can do for you in town?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing; I am much obliged to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you no message for anybody?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My love to your sister, if you please; and when you see my cousin, my
      cousin Edmund, I wish you would be so good as to say that I suppose I
      shall soon hear from him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly; and if he is lazy or negligent, I will write his excuses
      myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He could say no more, for Fanny would be no longer detained. He pressed
      her hand, looked at her, and was gone. <i>He</i> went to while away the
      next three hours as he could, with his other acquaintance, till the best
      dinner that a capital inn afforded was ready for their enjoyment, and <i>she</i>
      turned in to her more simple one immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their general fare bore a very different character; and could he have
      suspected how many privations, besides that of exercise, she endured in
      her father&rsquo;s house, he would have wondered that her looks were not much
      more affected than he found them. She was so little equal to Rebecca&rsquo;s
      puddings and Rebecca&rsquo;s hashes, brought to table, as they all were, with
      such accompaniments of half-cleaned plates, and not half-cleaned knives
      and forks, that she was very often constrained to defer her heartiest meal
      till she could send her brothers in the evening for biscuits and buns.
      After being nursed up at Mansfield, it was too late in the day to be
      hardened at Portsmouth; and though Sir Thomas, had he known all, might
      have thought his niece in the most promising way of being starved, both
      mind and body, into a much juster value for Mr. Crawford&rsquo;s good company
      and good fortune, he would probably have feared to push his experiment
      farther, lest she might die under the cure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fanny was out of spirits all the rest of the day. Though tolerably secure
      of not seeing Mr. Crawford again, she could not help being low. It was
      parting with somebody of the nature of a friend; and though, in one light,
      glad to have him gone, it seemed as if she was now deserted by everybody;
      it was a sort of renewed separation from Mansfield; and she could not
      think of his returning to town, and being frequently with Mary and Edmund,
      without feelings so near akin to envy as made her hate herself for having
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her dejection had no abatement from anything passing around her; a friend
      or two of her father&rsquo;s, as always happened if he was not with them, spent
      the long, long evening there; and from six o&rsquo;clock till half-past nine,
      there was little intermission of noise or grog. She was very low. The
      wonderful improvement which she still fancied in Mr. Crawford was the
      nearest to administering comfort of anything within the current of her
      thoughts. Not considering in how different a circle she had been just
      seeing him, nor how much might be owing to contrast, she was quite
      persuaded of his being astonishingly more gentle and regardful of others
      than formerly. And, if in little things, must it not be so in great? So
      anxious for her health and comfort, so very feeling as he now expressed
      himself, and really seemed, might not it be fairly supposed that he would
      not much longer persevere in a suit so distressing to her?

      CHAPTER XLIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was presumed that Mr. Crawford was travelling back, to London, on the
      morrow, for nothing more was seen of him at Mr. Price&rsquo;s; and two days
      afterwards, it was a fact ascertained to Fanny by the following letter
      from his sister, opened and read by her, on another account, with the most
      anxious curiosity:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have to inform you, my dearest Fanny, that Henry has been down to
      Portsmouth to see you; that he had a delightful walk with you to the
      dockyard last Saturday, and one still more to be dwelt on the next day, on
      the ramparts; when the balmy air, the sparkling sea, and your sweet looks
      and conversation were altogether in the most delicious harmony, and
      afforded sensations which are to raise ecstasy even in retrospect. This,
      as well as I understand, is to be the substance of my information. He
      makes me write, but I do not know what else is to be communicated, except
      this said visit to Portsmouth, and these two said walks, and his
      introduction to your family, especially to a fair sister of yours, a fine
      girl of fifteen, who was of the party on the ramparts, taking her first
      lesson, I presume, in love. I have not time for writing much, but it would
      be out of place if I had, for this is to be a mere letter of business,
      penned for the purpose of conveying necessary information, which could not
      be delayed without risk of evil. My dear, dear Fanny, if I had you here,
      how I would talk to you! You should listen to me till you were tired, and
      advise me till you were still tired more; but it is impossible to put a
      hundredth part of my great mind on paper, so I will abstain altogether,
      and leave you to guess what you like. I have no news for you. You have
      politics, of course; and it would be too bad to plague you with the names
      of people and parties that fill up my time. I ought to have sent you an
      account of your cousin&rsquo;s first party, but I was lazy, and now it is too
      long ago; suffice it, that everything was just as it ought to be, in a
      style that any of her connexions must have been gratified to witness, and
      that her own dress and manners did her the greatest credit. My friend,
      Mrs. Fraser, is mad for such a house, and it would not make <i>me</i>
      miserable. I go to Lady Stornaway after Easter; she seems in high spirits,
      and very happy. I fancy Lord S. is very good-humoured and pleasant in his
      own family, and I do not think him so very ill-looking as I did&mdash;at
      least, one sees many worse. He will not do by the side of your cousin
      Edmund. Of the last-mentioned hero, what shall I say? If I avoided his
      name entirely, it would look suspicious. I will say, then, that we have
      seen him two or three times, and that my friends here are very much struck
      with his gentlemanlike appearance. Mrs. Fraser (no bad judge) declares she
      knows but three men in town who have so good a person, height, and air;
      and I must confess, when he dined here the other day, there were none to
      compare with him, and we were a party of sixteen. Luckily there is no
      distinction of dress nowadays to tell tales, but&mdash;but&mdash;but Yours
      affectionately.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had almost forgot (it was Edmund&rsquo;s fault: he gets into my head more
      than does me good) one very material thing I had to say from Henry and
      myself&mdash;I mean about our taking you back into Northamptonshire. My
      dear little creature, do not stay at Portsmouth to lose your pretty looks.
      Those vile sea-breezes are the ruin of beauty and health. My poor aunt
      always felt affected if within ten miles of the sea, which the Admiral of
      course never believed, but I know it was so. I am at your service and
      Henry&rsquo;s, at an hour&rsquo;s notice. I should like the scheme, and we would make
      a little circuit, and shew you Everingham in our way, and perhaps you
      would not mind passing through London, and seeing the inside of St.
      George&rsquo;s, Hanover Square. Only keep your cousin Edmund from me at such a
      time: I should not like to be tempted. What a long letter! one word more.
      Henry, I find, has some idea of going into Norfolk again upon some
      business that <i>you</i> approve; but this cannot possibly be permitted
      before the middle of next week; that is, he cannot anyhow be spared till
      after the 14th, for <i>we</i> have a party that evening. The value of a
      man like Henry, on such an occasion, is what you can have no conception
      of; so you must take it upon my word to be inestimable. He will see the
      Rushworths, which own I am not sorry for&mdash;having a little curiosity,
      and so I think has he&mdash;though he will not acknowledge it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was a letter to be run through eagerly, to be read deliberately, to
      supply matter for much reflection, and to leave everything in greater
      suspense than ever. The only certainty to be drawn from it was, that
      nothing decisive had yet taken place. Edmund had not yet spoken. How Miss
      Crawford really felt, how she meant to act, or might act without or
      against her meaning; whether his importance to her were quite what it had
      been before the last separation; whether, if lessened, it were likely to
      lessen more, or to recover itself, were subjects for endless conjecture,
      and to be thought of on that day and many days to come, without producing
      any conclusion. The idea that returned the oftenest was that Miss
      Crawford, after proving herself cooled and staggered by a return to London
      habits, would yet prove herself in the end too much attached to him to
      give him up. She would try to be more ambitious than her heart would
      allow. She would hesitate, she would tease, she would condition, she would
      require a great deal, but she would finally accept.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was Fanny&rsquo;s most frequent expectation. A house in town&mdash;that,
      she thought, must be impossible. Yet there was no saying what Miss
      Crawford might not ask. The prospect for her cousin grew worse and worse.
      The woman who could speak of him, and speak only of his appearance! What
      an unworthy attachment! To be deriving support from the commendations of
      Mrs. Fraser! <i>She</i> who had known him intimately half a year! Fanny
      was ashamed of her. Those parts of the letter which related only to Mr.
      Crawford and herself, touched her, in comparison, slightly. Whether Mr.
      Crawford went into Norfolk before or after the 14th was certainly no
      concern of hers, though, everything considered, she thought he <i>would</i>
      go without delay. That Miss Crawford should endeavour to secure a meeting
      between him and Mrs. Rushworth, was all in her worst line of conduct, and
      grossly unkind and ill-judged; but she hoped <i>he</i> would not be
      actuated by any such degrading curiosity. He acknowledged no such
      inducement, and his sister ought to have given him credit for better
      feelings than her own.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was yet more impatient for another letter from town after receiving
      this than she had been before; and for a few days was so unsettled by it
      altogether, by what had come, and what might come, that her usual readings
      and conversation with Susan were much suspended. She could not command her
      attention as she wished. If Mr. Crawford remembered her message to her
      cousin, she thought it very likely, most likely, that he would write to
      her at all events; it would be most consistent with his usual kindness;
      and till she got rid of this idea, till it gradually wore off, by no
      letters appearing in the course of three or four days more, she was in a
      most restless, anxious state.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length, a something like composure succeeded. Suspense must be
      submitted to, and must not be allowed to wear her out, and make her
      useless. Time did something, her own exertions something more, and she
      resumed her attentions to Susan, and again awakened the same interest in
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Susan was growing very fond of her, and though without any of the early
      delight in books which had been so strong in Fanny, with a disposition
      much less inclined to sedentary pursuits, or to information for
      information&rsquo;s sake, she had so strong a desire of not <i>appearing</i>
      ignorant, as, with a good clear understanding, made her a most attentive,
      profitable, thankful pupil. Fanny was her oracle. Fanny&rsquo;s explanations and
      remarks were a most important addition to every essay, or every chapter of
      history. What Fanny told her of former times dwelt more on her mind than
      the pages of Goldsmith; and she paid her sister the compliment of
      preferring her style to that of any printed author. The early habit of
      reading was wanting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their conversations, however, were not always on subjects so high as
      history or morals. Others had their hour; and of lesser matters, none
      returned so often, or remained so long between them, as Mansfield Park, a
      description of the people, the manners, the amusements, the ways of
      Mansfield Park. Susan, who had an innate taste for the genteel and
      well-appointed, was eager to hear, and Fanny could not but indulge herself
      in dwelling on so beloved a theme. She hoped it was not wrong; though,
      after a time, Susan&rsquo;s very great admiration of everything said or done in
      her uncle&rsquo;s house, and earnest longing to go into Northamptonshire, seemed
      almost to blame her for exciting feelings which could not be gratified.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Susan was very little better fitted for home than her elder sister;
      and as Fanny grew thoroughly to understand this, she began to feel that
      when her own release from Portsmouth came, her happiness would have a
      material drawback in leaving Susan behind. That a girl so capable of being
      made everything good should be left in such hands, distressed her more and
      more. Were <i>she</i> likely to have a home to invite her to, what a
      blessing it would be! And had it been possible for her to return Mr.
      Crawford&rsquo;s regard, the probability of his being very far from objecting to
      such a measure would have been the greatest increase of all her own
      comforts. She thought he was really good-tempered, and could fancy his
      entering into a plan of that sort most pleasantly.

      CHAPTER XLIV
    </h2>
    <p>
      Seven weeks of the two months were very nearly gone, when the one letter,
      the letter from Edmund, so long expected, was put into Fanny&rsquo;s hands. As
      she opened, and saw its length, she prepared herself for a minute detail
      of happiness and a profusion of love and praise towards the fortunate
      creature who was now mistress of his fate. These were the contents&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My Dear Fanny,&mdash;Excuse me that I have not written before. Crawford
      told me that you were wishing to hear from me, but I found it impossible
      to write from London, and persuaded myself that you would understand my
      silence. Could I have sent a few happy lines, they should not have been
      wanting, but nothing of that nature was ever in my power. I am returned to
      Mansfield in a less assured state than when I left it. My hopes are much
      weaker. You are probably aware of this already. So very fond of you as
      Miss Crawford is, it is most natural that she should tell you enough of
      her own feelings to furnish a tolerable guess at mine. I will not be
      prevented, however, from making my own communication. Our confidences in
      you need not clash. I ask no questions. There is something soothing in the
      idea that we have the same friend, and that whatever unhappy differences
      of opinion may exist between us, we are united in our love of you. It will
      be a comfort to me to tell you how things now are, and what are my present
      plans, if plans I can be said to have. I have been returned since
      Saturday. I was three weeks in London, and saw her (for London) very
      often. I had every attention from the Frasers that could be reasonably
      expected. I dare say I was not reasonable in carrying with me hopes of an
      intercourse at all like that of Mansfield. It was her manner, however,
      rather than any unfrequency of meeting. Had she been different when I did
      see her, I should have made no complaint, but from the very first she was
      altered: my first reception was so unlike what I had hoped, that I had
      almost resolved on leaving London again directly. I need not
      particularise. You know the weak side of her character, and may imagine
      the sentiments and expressions which were torturing me. She was in high
      spirits, and surrounded by those who were giving all the support of their
      own bad sense to her too lively mind. I do not like Mrs. Fraser. She is a
      cold-hearted, vain woman, who has married entirely from convenience, and
      though evidently unhappy in her marriage, places her disappointment not to
      faults of judgment, or temper, or disproportion of age, but to her being,
      after all, less affluent than many of her acquaintance, especially than
      her sister, Lady Stornaway, and is the determined supporter of everything
      mercenary and ambitious, provided it be only mercenary and ambitious
      enough. I look upon her intimacy with those two sisters as the greatest
      misfortune of her life and mine. They have been leading her astray for
      years. Could she be detached from them!&mdash;and sometimes I do not
      despair of it, for the affection appears to me principally on their side.
      They are very fond of her; but I am sure she does not love them as she
      loves you. When I think of her great attachment to you, indeed, and the
      whole of her judicious, upright conduct as a sister, she appears a very
      different creature, capable of everything noble, and I am ready to blame
      myself for a too harsh construction of a playful manner. I cannot give her
      up, Fanny. She is the only woman in the world whom I could ever think of
      as a wife. If I did not believe that she had some regard for me, of course
      I should not say this, but I do believe it. I am convinced that she is not
      without a decided preference. I have no jealousy of any individual. It is
      the influence of the fashionable world altogether that I am jealous of. It
      is the habits of wealth that I fear. Her ideas are not higher than her own
      fortune may warrant, but they are beyond what our incomes united could
      authorise. There is comfort, however, even here. I could better bear to
      lose her because not rich enough, than because of my profession. That
      would only prove her affection not equal to sacrifices, which, in fact, I
      am scarcely justified in asking; and, if I am refused, that, I think, will
      be the honest motive. Her prejudices, I trust, are not so strong as they
      were. You have my thoughts exactly as they arise, my dear Fanny; perhaps
      they are sometimes contradictory, but it will not be a less faithful
      picture of my mind. Having once begun, it is a pleasure to me to tell you
      all I feel. I cannot give her up. Connected as we already are, and, I
      hope, are to be, to give up Mary Crawford would be to give up the society
      of some of those most dear to me; to banish myself from the very houses
      and friends whom, under any other distress, I should turn to for
      consolation. The loss of Mary I must consider as comprehending the loss of
      Crawford and of Fanny. Were it a decided thing, an actual refusal, I hope
      I should know how to bear it, and how to endeavour to weaken her hold on
      my heart, and in the course of a few years&mdash;but I am writing
      nonsense. Were I refused, I must bear it; and till I am, I can never cease
      to try for her. This is the truth. The only question is <i>how</i>? What
      may be the likeliest means? I have sometimes thought of going to London
      again after Easter, and sometimes resolved on doing nothing till she
      returns to Mansfield. Even now, she speaks with pleasure of being in
      Mansfield in June; but June is at a great distance, and I believe I shall
      write to her. I have nearly determined on explaining myself by letter. To
      be at an early certainty is a material object. My present state is
      miserably irksome. Considering everything, I think a letter will be
      decidedly the best method of explanation. I shall be able to write much
      that I could not say, and shall be giving her time for reflection before
      she resolves on her answer, and I am less afraid of the result of
      reflection than of an immediate hasty impulse; I think I am. My greatest
      danger would lie in her consulting Mrs. Fraser, and I at a distance unable
      to help my own cause. A letter exposes to all the evil of consultation,
      and where the mind is anything short of perfect decision, an adviser may,
      in an unlucky moment, lead it to do what it may afterwards regret. I must
      think this matter over a little. This long letter, full of my own concerns
      alone, will be enough to tire even the friendship of a Fanny. The last
      time I saw Crawford was at Mrs. Fraser&rsquo;s party. I am more and more
      satisfied with all that I see and hear of him. There is not a shadow of
      wavering. He thoroughly knows his own mind, and acts up to his
      resolutions: an inestimable quality. I could not see him and my eldest
      sister in the same room without recollecting what you once told me, and I
      acknowledge that they did not meet as friends. There was marked coolness
      on her side. They scarcely spoke. I saw him draw back surprised, and I was
      sorry that Mrs. Rushworth should resent any former supposed slight to Miss
      Bertram. You will wish to hear my opinion of Maria&rsquo;s degree of comfort as
      a wife. There is no appearance of unhappiness. I hope they get on pretty
      well together. I dined twice in Wimpole Street, and might have been there
      oftener, but it is mortifying to be with Rushworth as a brother. Julia
      seems to enjoy London exceedingly. I had little enjoyment there, but have
      less here. We are not a lively party. You are very much wanted. I miss you
      more than I can express. My mother desires her best love, and hopes to
      hear from you soon. She talks of you almost every hour, and I am sorry to
      find how many weeks more she is likely to be without you. My father means
      to fetch you himself, but it will not be till after Easter, when he has
      business in town. You are happy at Portsmouth, I hope, but this must not
      be a yearly visit. I want you at home, that I may have your opinion about
      Thornton Lacey. I have little heart for extensive improvements till I know
      that it will ever have a mistress. I think I shall certainly write. It is
      quite settled that the Grants go to Bath; they leave Mansfield on Monday.
      I am glad of it. I am not comfortable enough to be fit for anybody; but
      your aunt seems to feel out of luck that such an article of Mansfield news
      should fall to my pen instead of hers.&mdash;Yours ever, my dearest
      Fanny.&rdquo;

      &ldquo;I never will, no, I certainly never will wish for a letter again,&rdquo; was
      Fanny&rsquo;s secret declaration as she finished this. &ldquo;What do they bring but
      disappointment and sorrow? Not till after Easter! How shall I bear it? And
      my poor aunt talking of me every hour!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fanny checked the tendency of these thoughts as well as she could, but she
      was within half a minute of starting the idea that Sir Thomas was quite
      unkind, both to her aunt and to herself. As for the main subject of the
      letter, there was nothing in that to soothe irritation. She was almost
      vexed into displeasure and anger against Edmund. &ldquo;There is no good in this
      delay,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;Why is not it settled? He is blinded, and nothing will
      open his eyes; nothing can, after having had truths before him so long in
      vain. He will marry her, and be poor and miserable. God grant that her
      influence do not make him cease to be respectable!&rdquo; She looked over the
      letter again. &ldquo;&lsquo;So very fond of me!&rsquo; &lsquo;tis nonsense all. She loves nobody
      but herself and her brother. Her friends leading her astray for years! She
      is quite as likely to have led <i>them</i> astray. They have all, perhaps,
      been corrupting one another; but if they are so much fonder of her than
      she is of them, she is the less likely to have been hurt, except by their
      flattery. &lsquo;The only woman in the world whom he could ever think of as a
      wife.&rsquo; I firmly believe it. It is an attachment to govern his whole life.
      Accepted or refused, his heart is wedded to her for ever. &lsquo;The loss of
      Mary I must consider as comprehending the loss of Crawford and Fanny.&rsquo; 
      Edmund, you do not know me. The families would never be connected if you
      did not connect them! Oh! write, write. Finish it at once. Let there be an
      end of this suspense. Fix, commit, condemn yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Such sensations, however, were too near akin to resentment to be long
      guiding Fanny&rsquo;s soliloquies. She was soon more softened and sorrowful. His
      warm regard, his kind expressions, his confidential treatment, touched her
      strongly. He was only too good to everybody. It was a letter, in short,
      which she would not but have had for the world, and which could never be
      valued enough. This was the end of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everybody at all addicted to letter-writing, without having much to say,
      which will include a large proportion of the female world at least, must
      feel with Lady Bertram that she was out of luck in having such a capital
      piece of Mansfield news as the certainty of the Grants going to Bath,
      occur at a time when she could make no advantage of it, and will admit
      that it must have been very mortifying to her to see it fall to the share
      of her thankless son, and treated as concisely as possible at the end of a
      long letter, instead of having it to spread over the largest part of a
      page of her own. For though Lady Bertram rather shone in the epistolary
      line, having early in her marriage, from the want of other employment, and
      the circumstance of Sir Thomas&rsquo;s being in Parliament, got into the way of
      making and keeping correspondents, and formed for herself a very
      creditable, common-place, amplifying style, so that a very little matter
      was enough for her: she could not do entirely without any; she must have
      something to write about, even to her niece; and being so soon to lose all
      the benefit of Dr. Grant&rsquo;s gouty symptoms and Mrs. Grant&rsquo;s morning calls,
      it was very hard upon her to be deprived of one of the last epistolary
      uses she could put them to.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a rich amends, however, preparing for her. Lady Bertram&rsquo;s hour
      of good luck came. Within a few days from the receipt of Edmund&rsquo;s letter,
      Fanny had one from her aunt, beginning thus&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My Dear Fanny,&mdash;I take up my pen to communicate some very alarming
      intelligence, which I make no doubt will give you much concern&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was a great deal better than to have to take up the pen to acquaint
      her with all the particulars of the Grants&rsquo; intended journey, for the
      present intelligence was of a nature to promise occupation for the pen for
      many days to come, being no less than the dangerous illness of her eldest
      son, of which they had received notice by express a few hours before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom had gone from London with a party of young men to Newmarket, where a
      neglected fall and a good deal of drinking had brought on a fever; and
      when the party broke up, being unable to move, had been left by himself at
      the house of one of these young men to the comforts of sickness and
      solitude, and the attendance only of servants. Instead of being soon well
      enough to follow his friends, as he had then hoped, his disorder increased
      considerably, and it was not long before he thought so ill of himself as
      to be as ready as his physician to have a letter despatched to Mansfield.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This distressing intelligence, as you may suppose,&rdquo; observed her
      ladyship, after giving the substance of it, &ldquo;has agitated us exceedingly,
      and we cannot prevent ourselves from being greatly alarmed and
      apprehensive for the poor invalid, whose state Sir Thomas fears may be
      very critical; and Edmund kindly proposes attending his brother
      immediately, but I am happy to add that Sir Thomas will not leave me on
      this distressing occasion, as it would be too trying for me. We shall
      greatly miss Edmund in our small circle, but I trust and hope he will find
      the poor invalid in a less alarming state than might be apprehended, and
      that he will be able to bring him to Mansfield shortly, which Sir Thomas
      proposes should be done, and thinks best on every account, and I flatter
      myself the poor sufferer will soon be able to bear the removal without
      material inconvenience or injury. As I have little doubt of your feeling
      for us, my dear Fanny, under these distressing circumstances, I will write
      again very soon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fanny&rsquo;s feelings on the occasion were indeed considerably more warm and
      genuine than her aunt&rsquo;s style of writing. She felt truly for them all. Tom
      dangerously ill, Edmund gone to attend him, and the sadly small party
      remaining at Mansfield, were cares to shut out every other care, or almost
      every other. She could just find selfishness enough to wonder whether
      Edmund <i>had</i> written to Miss Crawford before this summons came, but
      no sentiment dwelt long with her that was not purely affectionate and
      disinterestedly anxious. Her aunt did not neglect her: she wrote again and
      again; they were receiving frequent accounts from Edmund, and these
      accounts were as regularly transmitted to Fanny, in the same diffuse
      style, and the same medley of trusts, hopes, and fears, all following and
      producing each other at haphazard. It was a sort of playing at being
      frightened. The sufferings which Lady Bertram did not see had little power
      over her fancy; and she wrote very comfortably about agitation, and
      anxiety, and poor invalids, till Tom was actually conveyed to Mansfield,
      and her own eyes had beheld his altered appearance. Then a letter which
      she had been previously preparing for Fanny was finished in a different
      style, in the language of real feeling and alarm; then she wrote as she
      might have spoken. &ldquo;He is just come, my dear Fanny, and is taken upstairs;
      and I am so shocked to see him, that I do not know what to do. I am sure
      he has been very ill. Poor Tom! I am quite grieved for him, and very much
      frightened, and so is Sir Thomas; and how glad I should be if you were
      here to comfort me. But Sir Thomas hopes he will be better to-morrow, and
      says we must consider his journey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The real solicitude now awakened in the maternal bosom was not soon over.
      Tom&rsquo;s extreme impatience to be removed to Mansfield, and experience those
      comforts of home and family which had been little thought of in
      uninterrupted health, had probably induced his being conveyed thither too
      early, as a return of fever came on, and for a week he was in a more
      alarming state than ever. They were all very seriously frightened. Lady
      Bertram wrote her daily terrors to her niece, who might now be said to
      live upon letters, and pass all her time between suffering from that of
      to-day and looking forward to to-morrow&rsquo;s. Without any particular
      affection for her eldest cousin, her tenderness of heart made her feel
      that she could not spare him, and the purity of her principles added yet a
      keener solicitude, when she considered how little useful, how little
      self-denying his life had (apparently) been.
    </p>
    <p>
      Susan was her only companion and listener on this, as on more common
      occasions. Susan was always ready to hear and to sympathise. Nobody else
      could be interested in so remote an evil as illness in a family above an
      hundred miles off; not even Mrs. Price, beyond a brief question or two, if
      she saw her daughter with a letter in her hand, and now and then the quiet
      observation of, &ldquo;My poor sister Bertram must be in a great deal of
      trouble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So long divided and so differently situated, the ties of blood were little
      more than nothing. An attachment, originally as tranquil as their tempers,
      was now become a mere name. Mrs. Price did quite as much for Lady Bertram
      as Lady Bertram would have done for Mrs. Price. Three or four Prices might
      have been swept away, any or all except Fanny and William, and Lady
      Bertram would have thought little about it; or perhaps might have caught
      from Mrs. Norris&rsquo;s lips the cant of its being a very happy thing and a
      great blessing to their poor dear sister Price to have them so well
      provided for.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XLV
    </h2>
    <p>
      At about the week&rsquo;s end from his return to Mansfield, Tom&rsquo;s immediate
      danger was over, and he was so far pronounced safe as to make his mother
      perfectly easy; for being now used to the sight of him in his suffering,
      helpless state, and hearing only the best, and never thinking beyond what
      she heard, with no disposition for alarm and no aptitude at a hint, Lady
      Bertram was the happiest subject in the world for a little medical
      imposition. The fever was subdued; the fever had been his complaint; of
      course he would soon be well again. Lady Bertram could think nothing less,
      and Fanny shared her aunt&rsquo;s security, till she received a few lines from
      Edmund, written purposely to give her a clearer idea of his brother&rsquo;s
      situation, and acquaint her with the apprehensions which he and his father
      had imbibed from the physician with respect to some strong hectic
      symptoms, which seemed to seize the frame on the departure of the fever.
      They judged it best that Lady Bertram should not be harassed by alarms
      which, it was to be hoped, would prove unfounded; but there was no reason
      why Fanny should not know the truth. They were apprehensive for his lungs.
    </p>
    <p>
      A very few lines from Edmund shewed her the patient and the sickroom in a
      juster and stronger light than all Lady Bertram&rsquo;s sheets of paper could
      do. There was hardly any one in the house who might not have described,
      from personal observation, better than herself; not one who was not more
      useful at times to her son. She could do nothing but glide in quietly and
      look at him; but when able to talk or be talked to, or read to, Edmund was
      the companion he preferred. His aunt worried him by her cares, and Sir
      Thomas knew not how to bring down his conversation or his voice to the
      level of irritation and feebleness. Edmund was all in all. Fanny would
      certainly believe him so at least, and must find that her estimation of
      him was higher than ever when he appeared as the attendant, supporter,
      cheerer of a suffering brother. There was not only the debility of recent
      illness to assist: there was also, as she now learnt, nerves much
      affected, spirits much depressed to calm and raise, and her own
      imagination added that there must be a mind to be properly guided.
    </p>
    <p>
      The family were not consumptive, and she was more inclined to hope than
      fear for her cousin, except when she thought of Miss Crawford; but Miss
      Crawford gave her the idea of being the child of good luck, and to her
      selfishness and vanity it would be good luck to have Edmund the only son.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even in the sick chamber the fortunate Mary was not forgotten. Edmund&rsquo;s
      letter had this postscript. &ldquo;On the subject of my last, I had actually
      begun a letter when called away by Tom&rsquo;s illness, but I have now changed
      my mind, and fear to trust the influence of friends. When Tom is better, I
      shall go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Such was the state of Mansfield, and so it continued, with scarcely any
      change, till Easter. A line occasionally added by Edmund to his mother&rsquo;s
      letter was enough for Fanny&rsquo;s information. Tom&rsquo;s amendment was alarmingly
      slow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Easter came particularly late this year, as Fanny had most sorrowfully
      considered, on first learning that she had no chance of leaving Portsmouth
      till after it. It came, and she had yet heard nothing of her return&mdash;nothing
      even of the going to London, which was to precede her return. Her aunt
      often expressed a wish for her, but there was no notice, no message from
      the uncle on whom all depended. She supposed he could not yet leave his
      son, but it was a cruel, a terrible delay to her. The end of April was
      coming on; it would soon be almost three months, instead of two, that she
      had been absent from them all, and that her days had been passing in a
      state of penance, which she loved them too well to hope they would
      thoroughly understand; and who could yet say when there might be leisure
      to think of or fetch her?
    </p>
    <p>
      Her eagerness, her impatience, her longings to be with them, were such as
      to bring a line or two of Cowper&rsquo;s Tirocinium for ever before her. &ldquo;With
      what intense desire she wants her home,&rdquo; was continually on her tongue, as
      the truest description of a yearning which she could not suppose any
      schoolboy&rsquo;s bosom to feel more keenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she had been coming to Portsmouth, she had loved to call it her home,
      had been fond of saying that she was going home; the word had been very
      dear to her, and so it still was, but it must be applied to Mansfield. <i>That</i>
      was now the home. Portsmouth was Portsmouth; Mansfield was home. They had
      been long so arranged in the indulgence of her secret meditations, and
      nothing was more consolatory to her than to find her aunt using the same
      language: &ldquo;I cannot but say I much regret your being from home at this
      distressing time, so very trying to my spirits. I trust and hope, and
      sincerely wish you may never be absent from home so long again,&rdquo; were most
      delightful sentences to her. Still, however, it was her private regale.
      Delicacy to her parents made her careful not to betray such a preference
      of her uncle&rsquo;s house. It was always: &ldquo;When I go back into
      Northamptonshire, or when I return to Mansfield, I shall do so and so.&rdquo;
       For a great while it was so, but at last the longing grew stronger, it
      overthrew caution, and she found herself talking of what she should do
      when she went home before she was aware. She reproached herself, coloured,
      and looked fearfully towards her father and mother. She need not have been
      uneasy. There was no sign of displeasure, or even of hearing her. They
      were perfectly free from any jealousy of Mansfield. She was as welcome to
      wish herself there as to be there.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was sad to Fanny to lose all the pleasures of spring. She had not known
      before what pleasures she <i>had</i> to lose in passing March and April in
      a town. She had not known before how much the beginnings and progress of
      vegetation had delighted her. What animation, both of body and mind, she
      had derived from watching the advance of that season which cannot, in
      spite of its capriciousness, be unlovely, and seeing its increasing
      beauties from the earliest flowers in the warmest divisions of her aunt&rsquo;s
      garden, to the opening of leaves of her uncle&rsquo;s plantations, and the glory
      of his woods. To be losing such pleasures was no trifle; to be losing
      them, because she was in the midst of closeness and noise, to have
      confinement, bad air, bad smells, substituted for liberty, freshness,
      fragrance, and verdure, was infinitely worse: but even these incitements
      to regret were feeble, compared with what arose from the conviction of
      being missed by her best friends, and the longing to be useful to those
      who were wanting her!
    </p>
    <p>
      Could she have been at home, she might have been of service to every
      creature in the house. She felt that she must have been of use to all. To
      all she must have saved some trouble of head or hand; and were it only in
      supporting the spirits of her aunt Bertram, keeping her from the evil of
      solitude, or the still greater evil of a restless, officious companion,
      too apt to be heightening danger in order to enhance her own importance,
      her being there would have been a general good. She loved to fancy how she
      could have read to her aunt, how she could have talked to her, and tried
      at once to make her feel the blessing of what was, and prepare her mind
      for what might be; and how many walks up and down stairs she might have
      saved her, and how many messages she might have carried.
    </p>
    <p>
      It astonished her that Tom&rsquo;s sisters could be satisfied with remaining in
      London at such a time, through an illness which had now, under different
      degrees of danger, lasted several weeks. <i>They</i> might return to
      Mansfield when they chose; travelling could be no difficulty to <i>them</i>,
      and she could not comprehend how both could still keep away. If Mrs.
      Rushworth could imagine any interfering obligations, Julia was certainly
      able to quit London whenever she chose. It appeared from one of her aunt&rsquo;s
      letters that Julia had offered to return if wanted, but this was all. It
      was evident that she would rather remain where she was.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fanny was disposed to think the influence of London very much at war with
      all respectable attachments. She saw the proof of it in Miss Crawford, as
      well as in her cousins; <i>her</i> attachment to Edmund had been
      respectable, the most respectable part of her character; her friendship
      for herself had at least been blameless. Where was either sentiment now?
      It was so long since Fanny had had any letter from her, that she had some
      reason to think lightly of the friendship which had been so dwelt on. It
      was weeks since she had heard anything of Miss Crawford or of her other
      connexions in town, except through Mansfield, and she was beginning to
      suppose that she might never know whether Mr. Crawford had gone into
      Norfolk again or not till they met, and might never hear from his sister
      any more this spring, when the following letter was received to revive old
      and create some new sensations&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive me, my dear Fanny, as soon as you can, for my long silence, and
      behave as if you could forgive me directly. This is my modest request and
      expectation, for you are so good, that I depend upon being treated better
      than I deserve, and I write now to beg an immediate answer. I want to know
      the state of things at Mansfield Park, and you, no doubt, are perfectly
      able to give it. One should be a brute not to feel for the distress they
      are in; and from what I hear, poor Mr. Bertram has a bad chance of
      ultimate recovery. I thought little of his illness at first. I looked upon
      him as the sort of person to be made a fuss with, and to make a fuss
      himself in any trifling disorder, and was chiefly concerned for those who
      had to nurse him; but now it is confidently asserted that he is really in
      a decline, that the symptoms are most alarming, and that part of the
      family, at least, are aware of it. If it be so, I am sure you must be
      included in that part, that discerning part, and therefore entreat you to
      let me know how far I have been rightly informed. I need not say how
      rejoiced I shall be to hear there has been any mistake, but the report is
      so prevalent that I confess I cannot help trembling. To have such a fine
      young man cut off in the flower of his days is most melancholy. Poor Sir
      Thomas will feel it dreadfully. I really am quite agitated on the subject.
      Fanny, Fanny, I see you smile and look cunning, but, upon my honour, I
      never bribed a physician in my life. Poor young man! If he is to die,
      there will be <i>two</i> poor young men less in the world; and with a
      fearless face and bold voice would I say to any one, that wealth and
      consequence could fall into no hands more deserving of them. It was a
      foolish precipitation last Christmas, but the evil of a few days may be
      blotted out in part. Varnish and gilding hide many stains. It will be but
      the loss of the Esquire after his name. With real affection, Fanny, like
      mine, more might be overlooked. Write to me by return of post, judge of my
      anxiety, and do not trifle with it. Tell me the real truth, as you have it
      from the fountainhead. And now, do not trouble yourself to be ashamed of
      either my feelings or your own. Believe me, they are not only natural,
      they are philanthropic and virtuous. I put it to your conscience, whether
      &lsquo;Sir Edmund&rsquo; would not do more good with all the Bertram property than any
      other possible &lsquo;Sir.&rsquo; Had the Grants been at home I would not have
      troubled you, but you are now the only one I can apply to for the truth,
      his sisters not being within my reach. Mrs. R. has been spending the
      Easter with the Aylmers at Twickenham (as to be sure you know), and is not
      yet returned; and Julia is with the cousins who live near Bedford Square,
      but I forget their name and street. Could I immediately apply to either,
      however, I should still prefer you, because it strikes me that they have
      all along been so unwilling to have their own amusements cut up, as to
      shut their eyes to the truth. I suppose Mrs. R.&lsquo;s Easter holidays will not
      last much longer; no doubt they are thorough holidays to her. The Aylmers
      are pleasant people; and her husband away, she can have nothing but
      enjoyment. I give her credit for promoting his going dutifully down to
      Bath, to fetch his mother; but how will she and the dowager agree in one
      house? Henry is not at hand, so I have nothing to say from him. Do not you
      think Edmund would have been in town again long ago, but for this illness?&mdash;Yours
      ever, Mary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had actually begun folding my letter when Henry walked in, but he
      brings no intelligence to prevent my sending it. Mrs. R. knows a decline
      is apprehended; he saw her this morning: she returns to Wimpole Street
      to-day; the old lady is come. Now do not make yourself uneasy with any
      queer fancies because he has been spending a few days at Richmond. He does
      it every spring. Be assured he cares for nobody but you. At this very
      moment he is wild to see you, and occupied only in contriving the means
      for doing so, and for making his pleasure conduce to yours. In proof, he
      repeats, and more eagerly, what he said at Portsmouth about our conveying
      you home, and I join him in it with all my soul. Dear Fanny, write
      directly, and tell us to come. It will do us all good. He and I can go to
      the Parsonage, you know, and be no trouble to our friends at Mansfield
      Park. It would really be gratifying to see them all again, and a little
      addition of society might be of infinite use to them; and as to yourself,
      you must feel yourself to be so wanted there, that you cannot in
      conscience&mdash;conscientious as you are&mdash;keep away, when you have
      the means of returning. I have not time or patience to give half Henry&rsquo;s
      messages; be satisfied that the spirit of each and every one is
      unalterable affection.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fanny&rsquo;s disgust at the greater part of this letter, with her extreme
      reluctance to bring the writer of it and her cousin Edmund together, would
      have made her (as she felt) incapable of judging impartially whether the
      concluding offer might be accepted or not. To herself, individually, it
      was most tempting. To be finding herself, perhaps within three days,
      transported to Mansfield, was an image of the greatest felicity, but it
      would have been a material drawback to be owing such felicity to persons
      in whose feelings and conduct, at the present moment, she saw so much to
      condemn: the sister&rsquo;s feelings, the brother&rsquo;s conduct, <i>her</i>
      cold-hearted ambition, <i>his</i> thoughtless vanity. To have him still
      the acquaintance, the flirt perhaps, of Mrs. Rushworth! She was mortified.
      She had thought better of him. Happily, however, she was not left to weigh
      and decide between opposite inclinations and doubtful notions of right;
      there was no occasion to determine whether she ought to keep Edmund and
      Mary asunder or not. She had a rule to apply to, which settled everything.
      Her awe of her uncle, and her dread of taking a liberty with him, made it
      instantly plain to her what she had to do. She must absolutely decline the
      proposal. If he wanted, he would send for her; and even to offer an early
      return was a presumption which hardly anything would have seemed to
      justify. She thanked Miss Crawford, but gave a decided negative. &ldquo;Her
      uncle, she understood, meant to fetch her; and as her cousin&rsquo;s illness had
      continued so many weeks without her being thought at all necessary, she
      must suppose her return would be unwelcome at present, and that she should
      be felt an encumbrance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her representation of her cousin&rsquo;s state at this time was exactly
      according to her own belief of it, and such as she supposed would convey
      to the sanguine mind of her correspondent the hope of everything she was
      wishing for. Edmund would be forgiven for being a clergyman, it seemed,
      under certain conditions of wealth; and this, she suspected, was all the
      conquest of prejudice which he was so ready to congratulate himself upon.
      She had only learnt to think nothing of consequence but money.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XLVI
    </h2>
    <p>
      As Fanny could not doubt that her answer was conveying a real
      disappointment, she was rather in expectation, from her knowledge of Miss
      Crawford&rsquo;s temper, of being urged again; and though no second letter
      arrived for the space of a week, she had still the same feeling when it
      did come.
    </p>
    <p>
      On receiving it, she could instantly decide on its containing little
      writing, and was persuaded of its having the air of a letter of haste and
      business. Its object was unquestionable; and two moments were enough to
      start the probability of its being merely to give her notice that they
      should be in Portsmouth that very day, and to throw her into all the
      agitation of doubting what she ought to do in such a case. If two moments,
      however, can surround with difficulties, a third can disperse them; and
      before she had opened the letter, the possibility of Mr. and Miss
      Crawford&rsquo;s having applied to her uncle and obtained his permission was
      giving her ease. This was the letter&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A most scandalous, ill-natured rumour has just reached me, and I write,
      dear Fanny, to warn you against giving the least credit to it, should it
      spread into the country. Depend upon it, there is some mistake, and that a
      day or two will clear it up; at any rate, that Henry is blameless, and in
      spite of a moment&rsquo;s <i>etourderie</i>, thinks of nobody but you. Say not a
      word of it; hear nothing, surmise nothing, whisper nothing till I write
      again. I am sure it will be all hushed up, and nothing proved but
      Rushworth&rsquo;s folly. If they are gone, I would lay my life they are only
      gone to Mansfield Park, and Julia with them. But why would not you let us
      come for you? I wish you may not repent it.&mdash;Yours, etc.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fanny stood aghast. As no scandalous, ill-natured rumour had reached her,
      it was impossible for her to understand much of this strange letter. She
      could only perceive that it must relate to Wimpole Street and Mr.
      Crawford, and only conjecture that something very imprudent had just
      occurred in that quarter to draw the notice of the world, and to excite
      her jealousy, in Miss Crawford&rsquo;s apprehension, if she heard it. Miss
      Crawford need not be alarmed for her. She was only sorry for the parties
      concerned and for Mansfield, if the report should spread so far; but she
      hoped it might not. If the Rushworths were gone themselves to Mansfield,
      as was to be inferred from what Miss Crawford said, it was not likely that
      anything unpleasant should have preceded them, or at least should make any
      impression.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to Mr. Crawford, she hoped it might give him a knowledge of his own
      disposition, convince him that he was not capable of being steadily
      attached to any one woman in the world, and shame him from persisting any
      longer in addressing herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was very strange! She had begun to think he really loved her, and to
      fancy his affection for her something more than common; and his sister
      still said that he cared for nobody else. Yet there must have been some
      marked display of attentions to her cousin, there must have been some
      strong indiscretion, since her correspondent was not of a sort to regard a
      slight one.
    </p>
    <p>
      Very uncomfortable she was, and must continue, till she heard from Miss
      Crawford again. It was impossible to banish the letter from her thoughts,
      and she could not relieve herself by speaking of it to any human being.
      Miss Crawford need not have urged secrecy with so much warmth; she might
      have trusted to her sense of what was due to her cousin.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day came and brought no second letter. Fanny was disappointed.
      She could still think of little else all the morning; but, when her father
      came back in the afternoon with the daily newspaper as usual, she was so
      far from expecting any elucidation through such a channel that the subject
      was for a moment out of her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was deep in other musing. The remembrance of her first evening in that
      room, of her father and his newspaper, came across her. No candle was now
      wanted. The sun was yet an hour and half above the horizon. She felt that
      she had, indeed, been three months there; and the sun&rsquo;s rays falling
      strongly into the parlour, instead of cheering, made her still more
      melancholy, for sunshine appeared to her a totally different thing in a
      town and in the country. Here, its power was only a glare: a stifling,
      sickly glare, serving but to bring forward stains and dirt that might
      otherwise have slept. There was neither health nor gaiety in sunshine in a
      town. She sat in a blaze of oppressive heat, in a cloud of moving dust,
      and her eyes could only wander from the walls, marked by her father&rsquo;s
      head, to the table cut and notched by her brothers, where stood the
      tea-board never thoroughly cleaned, the cups and saucers wiped in streaks,
      the milk a mixture of motes floating in thin blue, and the bread and
      butter growing every minute more greasy than even Rebecca&rsquo;s hands had
      first produced it. Her father read his newspaper, and her mother lamented
      over the ragged carpet as usual, while the tea was in preparation, and
      wished Rebecca would mend it; and Fanny was first roused by his calling
      out to her, after humphing and considering over a particular paragraph:
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the name of your great cousins in town, Fan?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A moment&rsquo;s recollection enabled her to say, &ldquo;Rushworth, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And don&rsquo;t they live in Wimpole Street?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, there&rsquo;s the devil to pay among them, that&rsquo;s all! There&rdquo; (holding
      out the paper to her); &ldquo;much good may such fine relations do you. I don&rsquo;t
      know what Sir Thomas may think of such matters; he may be too much of the
      courtier and fine gentleman to like his daughter the less. But, by G&mdash;!
      if she belonged to <i>me</i>, I&rsquo;d give her the rope&rsquo;s end as long as I
      could stand over her. A little flogging for man and woman too would be the
      best way of preventing such things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fanny read to herself that &ldquo;it was with infinite concern the newspaper had
      to announce to the world a matrimonial <i>fracas</i> in the family of Mr.
      R. of Wimpole Street; the beautiful Mrs. R., whose name had not long been
      enrolled in the lists of Hymen, and who had promised to become so
      brilliant a leader in the fashionable world, having quitted her husband&rsquo;s
      roof in company with the well-known and captivating Mr. C., the intimate
      friend and associate of Mr. R., and it was not known even to the editor of
      the newspaper whither they were gone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a mistake, sir,&rdquo; said Fanny instantly; &ldquo;it must be a mistake, it
      cannot be true; it must mean some other people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She spoke from the instinctive wish of delaying shame; she spoke with a
      resolution which sprung from despair, for she spoke what she did not,
      could not believe herself. It had been the shock of conviction as she
      read. The truth rushed on her; and how she could have spoken at all, how
      she could even have breathed, was afterwards matter of wonder to herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Price cared too little about the report to make her much answer. &ldquo;It
      might be all a lie,&rdquo; he acknowledged; &ldquo;but so many fine ladies were going
      to the devil nowadays that way, that there was no answering for anybody.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, I hope it is not true,&rdquo; said Mrs. Price plaintively; &ldquo;it would be
      so very shocking! If I have spoken once to Rebecca about that carpet, I am
      sure I have spoke at least a dozen times; have not I, Betsey? And it would
      not be ten minutes&rsquo; work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The horror of a mind like Fanny&rsquo;s, as it received the conviction of such
      guilt, and began to take in some part of the misery that must ensue, can
      hardly be described. At first, it was a sort of stupefaction; but every
      moment was quickening her perception of the horrible evil. She could not
      doubt, she dared not indulge a hope, of the paragraph being false. Miss
      Crawford&rsquo;s letter, which she had read so often as to make every line her
      own, was in frightful conformity with it. Her eager defence of her
      brother, her hope of its being <i>hushed</i> <i>up</i>, her evident
      agitation, were all of a piece with something very bad; and if there was a
      woman of character in existence, who could treat as a trifle this sin of
      the first magnitude, who would try to gloss it over, and desire to have it
      unpunished, she could believe Miss Crawford to be the woman! Now she could
      see her own mistake as to <i>who</i> were gone, or <i>said</i> to be gone.
      It was not Mr. and Mrs. Rushworth; it was Mrs. Rushworth and Mr. Crawford.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fanny seemed to herself never to have been shocked before. There was no
      possibility of rest. The evening passed without a pause of misery, the
      night was totally sleepless. She passed only from feelings of sickness to
      shudderings of horror; and from hot fits of fever to cold. The event was
      so shocking, that there were moments even when her heart revolted from it
      as impossible: when she thought it could not be. A woman married only six
      months ago; a man professing himself devoted, even <i>engaged</i> to
      another; that other her near relation; the whole family, both families
      connected as they were by tie upon tie; all friends, all intimate
      together! It was too horrible a confusion of guilt, too gross a
      complication of evil, for human nature, not in a state of utter barbarism,
      to be capable of! yet her judgment told her it was so. <i>His</i>
      unsettled affections, wavering with his vanity, <i>Maria&rsquo;s</i> decided
      attachment, and no sufficient principle on either side, gave it
      possibility: Miss Crawford&rsquo;s letter stampt it a fact.
    </p>
    <p>
      What would be the consequence? Whom would it not injure? Whose views might
      it not affect? Whose peace would it not cut up for ever? Miss Crawford,
      herself, Edmund; but it was dangerous, perhaps, to tread such ground. She
      confined herself, or tried to confine herself, to the simple, indubitable
      family misery which must envelop all, if it were indeed a matter of
      certified guilt and public exposure. The mother&rsquo;s sufferings, the
      father&rsquo;s; there she paused. Julia&rsquo;s, Tom&rsquo;s, Edmund&rsquo;s; there a yet longer
      pause. They were the two on whom it would fall most horribly. Sir Thomas&rsquo;s
      parental solicitude and high sense of honour and decorum, Edmund&rsquo;s upright
      principles, unsuspicious temper, and genuine strength of feeling, made her
      think it scarcely possible for them to support life and reason under such
      disgrace; and it appeared to her that, as far as this world alone was
      concerned, the greatest blessing to every one of kindred with Mrs.
      Rushworth would be instant annihilation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing happened the next day, or the next, to weaken her terrors. Two
      posts came in, and brought no refutation, public or private. There was no
      second letter to explain away the first from Miss Crawford; there was no
      intelligence from Mansfield, though it was now full time for her to hear
      again from her aunt. This was an evil omen. She had, indeed, scarcely the
      shadow of a hope to soothe her mind, and was reduced to so low and wan and
      trembling a condition, as no mother, not unkind, except Mrs. Price could
      have overlooked, when the third day did bring the sickening knock, and a
      letter was again put into her hands. It bore the London postmark, and came
      from Edmund.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Fanny,&mdash;You know our present wretchedness. May God support you
      under your share! We have been here two days, but there is nothing to be
      done. They cannot be traced. You may not have heard of the last blow&mdash;Julia&rsquo;s
      elopement; she is gone to Scotland with Yates. She left London a few hours
      before we entered it. At any other time this would have been felt
      dreadfully. Now it seems nothing; yet it is an heavy aggravation. My
      father is not overpowered. More cannot be hoped. He is still able to think
      and act; and I write, by his desire, to propose your returning home. He is
      anxious to get you there for my mother&rsquo;s sake. I shall be at Portsmouth
      the morning after you receive this, and hope to find you ready to set off
      for Mansfield. My father wishes you to invite Susan to go with you for a
      few months. Settle it as you like; say what is proper; I am sure you will
      feel such an instance of his kindness at such a moment! Do justice to his
      meaning, however I may confuse it. You may imagine something of my present
      state. There is no end of the evil let loose upon us. You will see me
      early by the mail.&mdash;Yours, etc.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Never had Fanny more wanted a cordial. Never had she felt such a one as
      this letter contained. To-morrow! to leave Portsmouth to-morrow! She was,
      she felt she was, in the greatest danger of being exquisitely happy, while
      so many were miserable. The evil which brought such good to her! She
      dreaded lest she should learn to be insensible of it. To be going so soon,
      sent for so kindly, sent for as a comfort, and with leave to take Susan,
      was altogether such a combination of blessings as set her heart in a glow,
      and for a time seemed to distance every pain, and make her incapable of
      suitably sharing the distress even of those whose distress she thought of
      most. Julia&rsquo;s elopement could affect her comparatively but little; she was
      amazed and shocked; but it could not occupy her, could not dwell on her
      mind. She was obliged to call herself to think of it, and acknowledge it
      to be terrible and grievous, or it was escaping her, in the midst of all
      the agitating pressing joyful cares attending this summons to herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is nothing like employment, active indispensable employment, for
      relieving sorrow. Employment, even melancholy, may dispel melancholy, and
      her occupations were hopeful. She had so much to do, that not even the
      horrible story of Mrs. Rushworth&mdash;now fixed to the last point of
      certainty could affect her as it had done before. She had not time to be
      miserable. Within twenty-four hours she was hoping to be gone; her father
      and mother must be spoken to, Susan prepared, everything got ready.
      Business followed business; the day was hardly long enough. The happiness
      she was imparting, too, happiness very little alloyed by the black
      communication which must briefly precede it&mdash;the joyful consent of
      her father and mother to Susan&rsquo;s going with her&mdash;the general
      satisfaction with which the going of both seemed regarded, and the ecstasy
      of Susan herself, was all serving to support her spirits.
    </p>
    <p>
      The affliction of the Bertrams was little felt in the family. Mrs. Price
      talked of her poor sister for a few minutes, but how to find anything to
      hold Susan&rsquo;s clothes, because Rebecca took away all the boxes and spoilt
      them, was much more in her thoughts: and as for Susan, now unexpectedly
      gratified in the first wish of her heart, and knowing nothing personally
      of those who had sinned, or of those who were sorrowing&mdash;if she could
      help rejoicing from beginning to end, it was as much as ought to be
      expected from human virtue at fourteen.
    </p>
    <p>
      As nothing was really left for the decision of Mrs. Price, or the good
      offices of Rebecca, everything was rationally and duly accomplished, and
      the girls were ready for the morrow. The advantage of much sleep to
      prepare them for their journey was impossible. The cousin who was
      travelling towards them could hardly have less than visited their agitated
      spirits&mdash;one all happiness, the other all varying and indescribable
      perturbation.
    </p>
    <p>
      By eight in the morning Edmund was in the house. The girls heard his
      entrance from above, and Fanny went down. The idea of immediately seeing
      him, with the knowledge of what he must be suffering, brought back all her
      own first feelings. He so near her, and in misery. She was ready to sink
      as she entered the parlour. He was alone, and met her instantly; and she
      found herself pressed to his heart with only these words, just articulate,
      &ldquo;My Fanny, my only sister; my only comfort now!&rdquo; She could say nothing;
      nor for some minutes could he say more.
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned away to recover himself, and when he spoke again, though his
      voice still faltered, his manner shewed the wish of self-command, and the
      resolution of avoiding any farther allusion. &ldquo;Have you breakfasted? When
      shall you be ready? Does Susan go?&rdquo; were questions following each other
      rapidly. His great object was to be off as soon as possible. When
      Mansfield was considered, time was precious; and the state of his own mind
      made him find relief only in motion. It was settled that he should order
      the carriage to the door in half an hour. Fanny answered for their having
      breakfasted and being quite ready in half an hour. He had already ate, and
      declined staying for their meal. He would walk round the ramparts, and
      join them with the carriage. He was gone again; glad to get away even from
      Fanny.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked very ill; evidently suffering under violent emotions, which he
      was determined to suppress. She knew it must be so, but it was terrible to
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The carriage came; and he entered the house again at the same moment, just
      in time to spend a few minutes with the family, and be a witness&mdash;but
      that he saw nothing&mdash;of the tranquil manner in which the daughters
      were parted with, and just in time to prevent their sitting down to the
      breakfast-table, which, by dint of much unusual activity, was quite and
      completely ready as the carriage drove from the door. Fanny&rsquo;s last meal in
      her father&rsquo;s house was in character with her first: she was dismissed from
      it as hospitably as she had been welcomed.
    </p>
    <p>
      How her heart swelled with joy and gratitude as she passed the barriers of
      Portsmouth, and how Susan&rsquo;s face wore its broadest smiles, may be easily
      conceived. Sitting forwards, however, and screened by her bonnet, those
      smiles were unseen.
    </p>
    <p>
      The journey was likely to be a silent one. Edmund&rsquo;s deep sighs often
      reached Fanny. Had he been alone with her, his heart must have opened in
      spite of every resolution; but Susan&rsquo;s presence drove him quite into
      himself, and his attempts to talk on indifferent subjects could never be
      long supported.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fanny watched him with never-failing solicitude, and sometimes catching
      his eye, revived an affectionate smile, which comforted her; but the first
      day&rsquo;s journey passed without her hearing a word from him on the subjects
      that were weighing him down. The next morning produced a little more. Just
      before their setting out from Oxford, while Susan was stationed at a
      window, in eager observation of the departure of a large family from the
      inn, the other two were standing by the fire; and Edmund, particularly
      struck by the alteration in Fanny&rsquo;s looks, and from his ignorance of the
      daily evils of her father&rsquo;s house, attributing an undue share of the
      change, attributing <i>all</i> to the recent event, took her hand, and
      said in a low, but very expressive tone, &ldquo;No wonder&mdash;you must feel it&mdash;you
      must suffer. How a man who had once loved, could desert you! But <i>yours</i>&mdash;your
      regard was new compared with&mdash;&mdash;Fanny, think of <i>me</i>!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The first division of their journey occupied a long day, and brought them,
      almost knocked up, to Oxford; but the second was over at a much earlier
      hour. They were in the environs of Mansfield long before the usual
      dinner-time, and as they approached the beloved place, the hearts of both
      sisters sank a little. Fanny began to dread the meeting with her aunts and
      Tom, under so dreadful a humiliation; and Susan to feel with some anxiety,
      that all her best manners, all her lately acquired knowledge of what was
      practised here, was on the point of being called into action. Visions of
      good and ill breeding, of old vulgarisms and new gentilities, were before
      her; and she was meditating much upon silver forks, napkins, and
      finger-glasses. Fanny had been everywhere awake to the difference of the
      country since February; but when they entered the Park her perceptions and
      her pleasures were of the keenest sort. It was three months, full three
      months, since her quitting it, and the change was from winter to summer.
      Her eye fell everywhere on lawns and plantations of the freshest green;
      and the trees, though not fully clothed, were in that delightful state
      when farther beauty is known to be at hand, and when, while much is
      actually given to the sight, more yet remains for the imagination. Her
      enjoyment, however, was for herself alone. Edmund could not share it. She
      looked at him, but he was leaning back, sunk in a deeper gloom than ever,
      and with eyes closed, as if the view of cheerfulness oppressed him, and
      the lovely scenes of home must be shut out.
    </p>
    <p>
      It made her melancholy again; and the knowledge of what must be enduring
      there, invested even the house, modern, airy, and well situated as it was,
      with a melancholy aspect.
    </p>
    <p>
      By one of the suffering party within they were expected with such
      impatience as she had never known before. Fanny had scarcely passed the
      solemn-looking servants, when Lady Bertram came from the drawing-room to
      meet her; came with no indolent step; and falling on her neck, said, &ldquo;Dear
      Fanny! now I shall be comfortable.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XLVII
    </h2>
    <p>
      It had been a miserable party, each of the three believing themselves most
      miserable. Mrs. Norris, however, as most attached to Maria, was really the
      greatest sufferer. Maria was her first favourite, the dearest of all; the
      match had been her own contriving, as she had been wont with such pride of
      heart to feel and say, and this conclusion of it almost overpowered her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was an altered creature, quieted, stupefied, indifferent to everything
      that passed. The being left with her sister and nephew, and all the house
      under her care, had been an advantage entirely thrown away; she had been
      unable to direct or dictate, or even fancy herself useful. When really
      touched by affliction, her active powers had been all benumbed; and
      neither Lady Bertram nor Tom had received from her the smallest support or
      attempt at support. She had done no more for them than they had done for
      each other. They had been all solitary, helpless, and forlorn alike; and
      now the arrival of the others only established her superiority in
      wretchedness. Her companions were relieved, but there was no good for <i>her</i>.
      Edmund was almost as welcome to his brother as Fanny to her aunt; but Mrs.
      Norris, instead of having comfort from either, was but the more irritated
      by the sight of the person whom, in the blindness of her anger, she could
      have charged as the daemon of the piece. Had Fanny accepted Mr. Crawford
      this could not have happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      Susan too was a grievance. She had not spirits to notice her in more than
      a few repulsive looks, but she felt her as a spy, and an intruder, and an
      indigent niece, and everything most odious. By her other aunt, Susan was
      received with quiet kindness. Lady Bertram could not give her much time,
      or many words, but she felt her, as Fanny&rsquo;s sister, to have a claim at
      Mansfield, and was ready to kiss and like her; and Susan was more than
      satisfied, for she came perfectly aware that nothing but ill-humour was to
      be expected from aunt Norris; and was so provided with happiness, so
      strong in that best of blessings, an escape from many certain evils, that
      she could have stood against a great deal more indifference than she met
      with from the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was now left a good deal to herself, to get acquainted with the house
      and grounds as she could, and spent her days very happily in so doing,
      while those who might otherwise have attended to her were shut up, or
      wholly occupied each with the person quite dependent on them, at this
      time, for everything like comfort; Edmund trying to bury his own feelings
      in exertions for the relief of his brother&rsquo;s, and Fanny devoted to her
      aunt Bertram, returning to every former office with more than former zeal,
      and thinking she could never do enough for one who seemed so much to want
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      To talk over the dreadful business with Fanny, talk and lament, was all
      Lady Bertram&rsquo;s consolation. To be listened to and borne with, and hear the
      voice of kindness and sympathy in return, was everything that could be
      done for her. To be otherwise comforted was out of the question. The case
      admitted of no comfort. Lady Bertram did not think deeply, but, guided by
      Sir Thomas, she thought justly on all important points; and she saw,
      therefore, in all its enormity, what had happened, and neither endeavoured
      herself, nor required Fanny to advise her, to think little of guilt and
      infamy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her affections were not acute, nor was her mind tenacious. After a time,
      Fanny found it not impossible to direct her thoughts to other subjects,
      and revive some interest in the usual occupations; but whenever Lady
      Bertram <i>was</i> fixed on the event, she could see it only in one light,
      as comprehending the loss of a daughter, and a disgrace never to be wiped
      off.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fanny learnt from her all the particulars which had yet transpired. Her
      aunt was no very methodical narrator, but with the help of some letters to
      and from Sir Thomas, and what she already knew herself, and could
      reasonably combine, she was soon able to understand quite as much as she
      wished of the circumstances attending the story.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Rushworth had gone, for the Easter holidays, to Twickenham, with a
      family whom she had just grown intimate with: a family of lively,
      agreeable manners, and probably of morals and discretion to suit, for to
      <i>their</i> house Mr. Crawford had constant access at all times. His
      having been in the same neighbourhood Fanny already knew. Mr. Rushworth
      had been gone at this time to Bath, to pass a few days with his mother,
      and bring her back to town, and Maria was with these friends without any
      restraint, without even Julia; for Julia had removed from Wimpole Street
      two or three weeks before, on a visit to some relations of Sir Thomas; a
      removal which her father and mother were now disposed to attribute to some
      view of convenience on Mr. Yates&rsquo;s account. Very soon after the
      Rushworths&rsquo; return to Wimpole Street, Sir Thomas had received a letter
      from an old and most particular friend in London, who hearing and
      witnessing a good deal to alarm him in that quarter, wrote to recommend
      Sir Thomas&rsquo;s coming to London himself, and using his influence with his
      daughter to put an end to the intimacy which was already exposing her to
      unpleasant remarks, and evidently making Mr. Rushworth uneasy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Thomas was preparing to act upon this letter, without communicating
      its contents to any creature at Mansfield, when it was followed by
      another, sent express from the same friend, to break to him the almost
      desperate situation in which affairs then stood with the young people.
      Mrs. Rushworth had left her husband&rsquo;s house: Mr. Rushworth had been in
      great anger and distress to <i>him</i> (Mr. Harding) for his advice; Mr.
      Harding feared there had been <i>at</i> <i>least</i> very flagrant
      indiscretion. The maidservant of Mrs. Rushworth, senior, threatened
      alarmingly. He was doing all in his power to quiet everything, with the
      hope of Mrs. Rushworth&rsquo;s return, but was so much counteracted in Wimpole
      Street by the influence of Mr. Rushworth&rsquo;s mother, that the worst
      consequences might be apprehended.
    </p>
    <p>
      This dreadful communication could not be kept from the rest of the family.
      Sir Thomas set off, Edmund would go with him, and the others had been left
      in a state of wretchedness, inferior only to what followed the receipt of
      the next letters from London. Everything was by that time public beyond a
      hope. The servant of Mrs. Rushworth, the mother, had exposure in her
      power, and supported by her mistress, was not to be silenced. The two
      ladies, even in the short time they had been together, had disagreed; and
      the bitterness of the elder against her daughter-in-law might perhaps
      arise almost as much from the personal disrespect with which she had
      herself been treated as from sensibility for her son.
    </p>
    <p>
      However that might be, she was unmanageable. But had she been less
      obstinate, or of less weight with her son, who was always guided by the
      last speaker, by the person who could get hold of and shut him up, the
      case would still have been hopeless, for Mrs. Rushworth did not appear
      again, and there was every reason to conclude her to be concealed
      somewhere with Mr. Crawford, who had quitted his uncle&rsquo;s house, as for a
      journey, on the very day of her absenting herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Thomas, however, remained yet a little longer in town, in the hope of
      discovering and snatching her from farther vice, though all was lost on
      the side of character.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>His</i> present state Fanny could hardly bear to think of. There was
      but one of his children who was not at this time a source of misery to
      him. Tom&rsquo;s complaints had been greatly heightened by the shock of his
      sister&rsquo;s conduct, and his recovery so much thrown back by it, that even
      Lady Bertram had been struck by the difference, and all her alarms were
      regularly sent off to her husband; and Julia&rsquo;s elopement, the additional
      blow which had met him on his arrival in London, though its force had been
      deadened at the moment, must, she knew, be sorely felt. She saw that it
      was. His letters expressed how much he deplored it. Under any
      circumstances it would have been an unwelcome alliance; but to have it so
      clandestinely formed, and such a period chosen for its completion, placed
      Julia&rsquo;s feelings in a most unfavourable light, and severely aggravated the
      folly of her choice. He called it a bad thing, done in the worst manner,
      and at the worst time; and though Julia was yet as more pardonable than
      Maria as folly than vice, he could not but regard the step she had taken
      as opening the worst probabilities of a conclusion hereafter like her
      sister&rsquo;s. Such was his opinion of the set into which she had thrown
      herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fanny felt for him most acutely. He could have no comfort but in Edmund.
      Every other child must be racking his heart. His displeasure against
      herself she trusted, reasoning differently from Mrs. Norris, would now be
      done away. <i>She</i> should be justified. Mr. Crawford would have fully
      acquitted her conduct in refusing him; but this, though most material to
      herself, would be poor consolation to Sir Thomas. Her uncle&rsquo;s displeasure
      was terrible to her; but what could her justification or her gratitude and
      attachment do for him? His stay must be on Edmund alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was mistaken, however, in supposing that Edmund gave his father no
      present pain. It was of a much less poignant nature than what the others
      excited; but Sir Thomas was considering his happiness as very deeply
      involved in the offence of his sister and friend; cut off by it, as he
      must be, from the woman whom he had been pursuing with undoubted
      attachment and strong probability of success; and who, in everything but
      this despicable brother, would have been so eligible a connexion. He was
      aware of what Edmund must be suffering on his own behalf, in addition to
      all the rest, when they were in town: he had seen or conjectured his
      feelings; and, having reason to think that one interview with Miss
      Crawford had taken place, from which Edmund derived only increased
      distress, had been as anxious on that account as on others to get him out
      of town, and had engaged him in taking Fanny home to her aunt, with a view
      to his relief and benefit, no less than theirs. Fanny was not in the
      secret of her uncle&rsquo;s feelings, Sir Thomas not in the secret of Miss
      Crawford&rsquo;s character. Had he been privy to her conversation with his son,
      he would not have wished her to belong to him, though her twenty thousand
      pounds had been forty.
    </p>
    <p>
      That Edmund must be for ever divided from Miss Crawford did not admit of a
      doubt with Fanny; and yet, till she knew that he felt the same, her own
      conviction was insufficient. She thought he did, but she wanted to be
      assured of it. If he would now speak to her with the unreserve which had
      sometimes been too much for her before, it would be most consoling; but <i>that</i>
      she found was not to be. She seldom saw him: never alone. He probably
      avoided being alone with her. What was to be inferred? That his judgment
      submitted to all his own peculiar and bitter share of this family
      affliction, but that it was too keenly felt to be a subject of the
      slightest communication. This must be his state. He yielded, but it was
      with agonies which did not admit of speech. Long, long would it be ere
      Miss Crawford&rsquo;s name passed his lips again, or she could hope for a
      renewal of such confidential intercourse as had been.
    </p>
    <p>
      It <i>was</i> long. They reached Mansfield on Thursday, and it was not
      till Sunday evening that Edmund began to talk to her on the subject.
      Sitting with her on Sunday evening&mdash;a wet Sunday evening&mdash;the
      very time of all others when, if a friend is at hand, the heart must be
      opened, and everything told; no one else in the room, except his mother,
      who, after hearing an affecting sermon, had cried herself to sleep, it was
      impossible not to speak; and so, with the usual beginnings, hardly to be
      traced as to what came first, and the usual declaration that if she would
      listen to him for a few minutes, he should be very brief, and certainly
      never tax her kindness in the same way again; she need not fear a
      repetition; it would be a subject prohibited entirely: he entered upon the
      luxury of relating circumstances and sensations of the first interest to
      himself, to one of whose affectionate sympathy he was quite convinced.
    </p>
    <p>
      How Fanny listened, with what curiosity and concern, what pain and what
      delight, how the agitation of his voice was watched, and how carefully her
      own eyes were fixed on any object but himself, may be imagined. The
      opening was alarming. He had seen Miss Crawford. He had been invited to
      see her. He had received a note from Lady Stornaway to beg him to call;
      and regarding it as what was meant to be the last, last interview of
      friendship, and investing her with all the feelings of shame and
      wretchedness which Crawford&rsquo;s sister ought to have known, he had gone to
      her in such a state of mind, so softened, so devoted, as made it for a few
      moments impossible to Fanny&rsquo;s fears that it should be the last. But as he
      proceeded in his story, these fears were over. She had met him, he said,
      with a serious&mdash;certainly a serious&mdash;even an agitated air; but
      before he had been able to speak one intelligible sentence, she had
      introduced the subject in a manner which he owned had shocked him. &ldquo;&lsquo;I
      heard you were in town,&rsquo; said she; &lsquo;I wanted to see you. Let us talk over
      this sad business. What can equal the folly of our two relations?&rsquo; I could
      not answer, but I believe my looks spoke. She felt reproved. Sometimes how
      quick to feel! With a graver look and voice she then added, &lsquo;I do not mean
      to defend Henry at your sister&rsquo;s expense.&rsquo; So she began, but how she went
      on, Fanny, is not fit, is hardly fit to be repeated to you. I cannot
      recall all her words. I would not dwell upon them if I could. Their
      substance was great anger at the <i>folly</i> of each. She reprobated her
      brother&rsquo;s folly in being drawn on by a woman whom he had never cared for,
      to do what must lose him the woman he adored; but still more the folly of
      poor Maria, in sacrificing such a situation, plunging into such
      difficulties, under the idea of being really loved by a man who had long
      ago made his indifference clear. Guess what I must have felt. To hear the
      woman whom&mdash;no harsher name than folly given! So voluntarily, so
      freely, so coolly to canvass it! No reluctance, no horror, no feminine,
      shall I say, no modest loathings? This is what the world does. For where,
      Fanny, shall we find a woman whom nature had so richly endowed? Spoilt,
      spoilt!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After a little reflection, he went on with a sort of desperate calmness.
      &ldquo;I will tell you everything, and then have done for ever. She saw it only
      as folly, and that folly stamped only by exposure. The want of common
      discretion, of caution: his going down to Richmond for the whole time of
      her being at Twickenham; her putting herself in the power of a servant; it
      was the detection, in short&mdash;oh, Fanny! it was the detection, not the
      offence, which she reprobated. It was the imprudence which had brought
      things to extremity, and obliged her brother to give up every dearer plan
      in order to fly with her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stopt. &ldquo;And what,&rdquo; said Fanny (believing herself required to speak),
      &ldquo;what could you say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing, nothing to be understood. I was like a man stunned. She went on,
      began to talk of you; yes, then she began to talk of you, regretting, as
      well she might, the loss of such a&mdash;. There she spoke very
      rationally. But she has always done justice to you. &lsquo;He has thrown away,&rsquo; 
      said she, &lsquo;such a woman as he will never see again. She would have fixed
      him; she would have made him happy for ever.&rsquo; My dearest Fanny, I am
      giving you, I hope, more pleasure than pain by this retrospect of what
      might have been&mdash;but what never can be now. You do not wish me to be
      silent? If you do, give me but a look, a word, and I have done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No look or word was given.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank God,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;We were all disposed to wonder, but it seems to
      have been the merciful appointment of Providence that the heart which knew
      no guile should not suffer. She spoke of you with high praise and warm
      affection; yet, even here, there was alloy, a dash of evil; for in the
      midst of it she could exclaim, &lsquo;Why would not she have him? It is all her
      fault. Simple girl! I shall never forgive her. Had she accepted him as she
      ought, they might now have been on the point of marriage, and Henry would
      have been too happy and too busy to want any other object. He would have
      taken no pains to be on terms with Mrs. Rushworth again. It would have all
      ended in a regular standing flirtation, in yearly meetings at Sotherton
      and Everingham.&rsquo; Could you have believed it possible? But the charm is
      broken. My eyes are opened.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cruel!&rdquo; said Fanny, &ldquo;quite cruel. At such a moment to give way to gaiety,
      to speak with lightness, and to you! Absolute cruelty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cruelty, do you call it? We differ there. No, hers is not a cruel nature.
      I do not consider her as meaning to wound my feelings. The evil lies yet
      deeper: in her total ignorance, unsuspiciousness of there being such
      feelings; in a perversion of mind which made it natural to her to treat
      the subject as she did. She was speaking only as she had been used to hear
      others speak, as she imagined everybody else would speak. Hers are not
      faults of temper. She would not voluntarily give unnecessary pain to any
      one, and though I may deceive myself, I cannot but think that for me, for
      my feelings, she would&mdash;Hers are faults of principle, Fanny; of
      blunted delicacy and a corrupted, vitiated mind. Perhaps it is best for
      me, since it leaves me so little to regret. Not so, however. Gladly would
      I submit to all the increased pain of losing her, rather than have to
      think of her as I do. I told her so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; when I left her I told her so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long were you together?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Five-and-twenty minutes. Well, she went on to say that what remained now
      to be done was to bring about a marriage between them. She spoke of it,
      Fanny, with a steadier voice than I can.&rdquo; He was obliged to pause more
      than once as he continued. &ldquo;&lsquo;We must persuade Henry to marry her,&rsquo; said
      she; &lsquo;and what with honour, and the certainty of having shut himself out
      for ever from Fanny, I do not despair of it. Fanny he must give up. I do
      not think that even <i>he</i> could now hope to succeed with one of her
      stamp, and therefore I hope we may find no insuperable difficulty. My
      influence, which is not small shall all go that way; and when once
      married, and properly supported by her own family, people of
      respectability as they are, she may recover her footing in society to a
      certain degree. In some circles, we know, she would never be admitted, but
      with good dinners, and large parties, there will always be those who will
      be glad of her acquaintance; and there is, undoubtedly, more liberality
      and candour on those points than formerly. What I advise is, that your
      father be quiet. Do not let him injure his own cause by interference.
      Persuade him to let things take their course. If by any officious
      exertions of his, she is induced to leave Henry&rsquo;s protection, there will
      be much less chance of his marrying her than if she remain with him. I
      know how he is likely to be influenced. Let Sir Thomas trust to his honour
      and compassion, and it may all end well; but if he get his daughter away,
      it will be destroying the chief hold.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After repeating this, Edmund was so much affected that Fanny, watching him
      with silent, but most tender concern, was almost sorry that the subject
      had been entered on at all. It was long before he could speak again. At
      last, &ldquo;Now, Fanny,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I shall soon have done. I have told you the
      substance of all that she said. As soon as I could speak, I replied that I
      had not supposed it possible, coming in such a state of mind into that
      house as I had done, that anything could occur to make me suffer more, but
      that she had been inflicting deeper wounds in almost every sentence. That
      though I had, in the course of our acquaintance, been often sensible of
      some difference in our opinions, on points, too, of some moment, it had
      not entered my imagination to conceive the difference could be such as she
      had now proved it. That the manner in which she treated the dreadful crime
      committed by her brother and my sister (with whom lay the greater
      seduction I pretended not to say), but the manner in which she spoke of
      the crime itself, giving it every reproach but the right; considering its
      ill consequences only as they were to be braved or overborne by a defiance
      of decency and impudence in wrong; and last of all, and above all,
      recommending to us a compliance, a compromise, an acquiescence in the
      continuance of the sin, on the chance of a marriage which, thinking as I
      now thought of her brother, should rather be prevented than sought; all
      this together most grievously convinced me that I had never understood her
      before, and that, as far as related to mind, it had been the creature of
      my own imagination, not Miss Crawford, that I had been too apt to dwell on
      for many months past. That, perhaps, it was best for me; I had less to
      regret in sacrificing a friendship, feelings, hopes which must, at any
      rate, have been torn from me now. And yet, that I must and would confess
      that, could I have restored her to what she had appeared to me before, I
      would infinitely prefer any increase of the pain of parting, for the sake
      of carrying with me the right of tenderness and esteem. This is what I
      said, the purport of it; but, as you may imagine, not spoken so
      collectedly or methodically as I have repeated it to you. She was
      astonished, exceedingly astonished&mdash;more than astonished. I saw her
      change countenance. She turned extremely red. I imagined I saw a mixture
      of many feelings: a great, though short struggle; half a wish of yielding
      to truths, half a sense of shame, but habit, habit carried it. She would
      have laughed if she could. It was a sort of laugh, as she answered, &lsquo;A
      pretty good lecture, upon my word. Was it part of your last sermon? At
      this rate you will soon reform everybody at Mansfield and Thornton Lacey;
      and when I hear of you next, it may be as a celebrated preacher in some
      great society of Methodists, or as a missionary into foreign parts.&rsquo; She
      tried to speak carelessly, but she was not so careless as she wanted to
      appear. I only said in reply, that from my heart I wished her well, and
      earnestly hoped that she might soon learn to think more justly, and not
      owe the most valuable knowledge we could any of us acquire, the knowledge
      of ourselves and of our duty, to the lessons of affliction, and
      immediately left the room. I had gone a few steps, Fanny, when I heard the
      door open behind me. &lsquo;Mr. Bertram,&rsquo; said she. I looked back. &lsquo;Mr.
      Bertram,&rsquo; said she, with a smile; but it was a smile ill-suited to the
      conversation that had passed, a saucy playful smile, seeming to invite in
      order to subdue me; at least it appeared so to me. I resisted; it was the
      impulse of the moment to resist, and still walked on. I have since,
      sometimes, for a moment, regretted that I did not go back, but I know I
      was right, and such has been the end of our acquaintance. And what an
      acquaintance has it been! How have I been deceived! Equally in brother and
      sister deceived! I thank you for your patience, Fanny. This has been the
      greatest relief, and now we will have done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And such was Fanny&rsquo;s dependence on his words, that for five minutes she
      thought they <i>had</i> done. Then, however, it all came on again, or
      something very like it, and nothing less than Lady Bertram&rsquo;s rousing
      thoroughly up could really close such a conversation. Till that happened,
      they continued to talk of Miss Crawford alone, and how she had attached
      him, and how delightful nature had made her, and how excellent she would
      have been, had she fallen into good hands earlier. Fanny, now at liberty
      to speak openly, felt more than justified in adding to his knowledge of
      her real character, by some hint of what share his brother&rsquo;s state of
      health might be supposed to have in her wish for a complete
      reconciliation. This was not an agreeable intimation. Nature resisted it
      for a while. It would have been a vast deal pleasanter to have had her
      more disinterested in her attachment; but his vanity was not of a strength
      to fight long against reason. He submitted to believe that Tom&rsquo;s illness
      had influenced her, only reserving for himself this consoling thought,
      that considering the many counteractions of opposing habits, she had
      certainly been <i>more</i> attached to him than could have been expected,
      and for his sake been more near doing right. Fanny thought exactly the
      same; and they were also quite agreed in their opinion of the lasting
      effect, the indelible impression, which such a disappointment must make on
      his mind. Time would undoubtedly abate somewhat of his sufferings, but
      still it was a sort of thing which he never could get entirely the better
      of; and as to his ever meeting with any other woman who could&mdash;it was
      too impossible to be named but with indignation. Fanny&rsquo;s friendship was
      all that he had to cling to.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XLVIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Let other pens dwell on guilt and misery. I quit such odious subjects as
      soon as I can, impatient to restore everybody, not greatly in fault
      themselves, to tolerable comfort, and to have done with all the rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      My Fanny, indeed, at this very time, I have the satisfaction of knowing,
      must have been happy in spite of everything. She must have been a happy
      creature in spite of all that she felt, or thought she felt, for the
      distress of those around her. She had sources of delight that must force
      their way. She was returned to Mansfield Park, she was useful, she was
      beloved; she was safe from Mr. Crawford; and when Sir Thomas came back she
      had every proof that could be given in his then melancholy state of
      spirits, of his perfect approbation and increased regard; and happy as all
      this must make her, she would still have been happy without any of it, for
      Edmund was no longer the dupe of Miss Crawford.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is true that Edmund was very far from happy himself. He was suffering
      from disappointment and regret, grieving over what was, and wishing for
      what could never be. She knew it was so, and was sorry; but it was with a
      sorrow so founded on satisfaction, so tending to ease, and so much in
      harmony with every dearest sensation, that there are few who might not
      have been glad to exchange their greatest gaiety for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Thomas, poor Sir Thomas, a parent, and conscious of errors in his own
      conduct as a parent, was the longest to suffer. He felt that he ought not
      to have allowed the marriage; that his daughter&rsquo;s sentiments had been
      sufficiently known to him to render him culpable in authorising it; that
      in so doing he had sacrificed the right to the expedient, and been
      governed by motives of selfishness and worldly wisdom. These were
      reflections that required some time to soften; but time will do almost
      everything; and though little comfort arose on Mrs. Rushworth&rsquo;s side for
      the misery she had occasioned, comfort was to be found greater than he had
      supposed in his other children. Julia&rsquo;s match became a less desperate
      business than he had considered it at first. She was humble, and wishing
      to be forgiven; and Mr. Yates, desirous of being really received into the
      family, was disposed to look up to him and be guided. He was not very
      solid; but there was a hope of his becoming less trifling, of his being at
      least tolerably domestic and quiet; and at any rate, there was comfort in
      finding his estate rather more, and his debts much less, than he had
      feared, and in being consulted and treated as the friend best worth
      attending to. There was comfort also in Tom, who gradually regained his
      health, without regaining the thoughtlessness and selfishness of his
      previous habits. He was the better for ever for his illness. He had
      suffered, and he had learned to think: two advantages that he had never
      known before; and the self-reproach arising from the deplorable event in
      Wimpole Street, to which he felt himself accessory by all the dangerous
      intimacy of his unjustifiable theatre, made an impression on his mind
      which, at the age of six-and-twenty, with no want of sense or good
      companions, was durable in its happy effects. He became what he ought to
      be: useful to his father, steady and quiet, and not living merely for
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here was comfort indeed! and quite as soon as Sir Thomas could place
      dependence on such sources of good, Edmund was contributing to his
      father&rsquo;s ease by improvement in the only point in which he had given him
      pain before&mdash;improvement in his spirits. After wandering about and
      sitting under trees with Fanny all the summer evenings, he had so well
      talked his mind into submission as to be very tolerably cheerful again.
    </p>
    <p>
      These were the circumstances and the hopes which gradually brought their
      alleviation to Sir Thomas, deadening his sense of what was lost, and in
      part reconciling him to himself; though the anguish arising from the
      conviction of his own errors in the education of his daughters was never
      to be entirely done away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Too late he became aware how unfavourable to the character of any young
      people must be the totally opposite treatment which Maria and Julia had
      been always experiencing at home, where the excessive indulgence and
      flattery of their aunt had been continually contrasted with his own
      severity. He saw how ill he had judged, in expecting to counteract what
      was wrong in Mrs. Norris by its reverse in himself; clearly saw that he
      had but increased the evil by teaching them to repress their spirits in
      his presence so as to make their real disposition unknown to him, and
      sending them for all their indulgences to a person who had been able to
      attach them only by the blindness of her affection, and the excess of her
      praise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here had been grievous mismanagement; but, bad as it was, he gradually
      grew to feel that it had not been the most direful mistake in his plan of
      education. Something must have been wanting <i>within</i>, or time would
      have worn away much of its ill effect. He feared that principle, active
      principle, had been wanting; that they had never been properly taught to
      govern their inclinations and tempers by that sense of duty which can
      alone suffice. They had been instructed theoretically in their religion,
      but never required to bring it into daily practice. To be distinguished
      for elegance and accomplishments, the authorised object of their youth,
      could have had no useful influence that way, no moral effect on the mind.
      He had meant them to be good, but his cares had been directed to the
      understanding and manners, not the disposition; and of the necessity of
      self-denial and humility, he feared they had never heard from any lips
      that could profit them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bitterly did he deplore a deficiency which now he could scarcely
      comprehend to have been possible. Wretchedly did he feel, that with all
      the cost and care of an anxious and expensive education, he had brought up
      his daughters without their understanding their first duties, or his being
      acquainted with their character and temper.
    </p>
    <p>
      The high spirit and strong passions of Mrs. Rushworth, especially, were
      made known to him only in their sad result. She was not to be prevailed on
      to leave Mr. Crawford. She hoped to marry him, and they continued together
      till she was obliged to be convinced that such hope was vain, and till the
      disappointment and wretchedness arising from the conviction rendered her
      temper so bad, and her feelings for him so like hatred, as to make them
      for a while each other&rsquo;s punishment, and then induce a voluntary
      separation.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had lived with him to be reproached as the ruin of all his happiness
      in Fanny, and carried away no better consolation in leaving him than that
      she <i>had</i> divided them. What can exceed the misery of such a mind in
      such a situation?
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Rushworth had no difficulty in procuring a divorce; and so ended a
      marriage contracted under such circumstances as to make any better end the
      effect of good luck not to be reckoned on. She had despised him, and loved
      another; and he had been very much aware that it was so. The indignities
      of stupidity, and the disappointments of selfish passion, can excite
      little pity. His punishment followed his conduct, as did a deeper
      punishment the deeper guilt of his wife. <i>He</i> was released from the
      engagement to be mortified and unhappy, till some other pretty girl could
      attract him into matrimony again, and he might set forward on a second,
      and, it is to be hoped, more prosperous trial of the state: if duped, to
      be duped at least with good humour and good luck; while she must withdraw
      with infinitely stronger feelings to a retirement and reproach which could
      allow no second spring of hope or character.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where she could be placed became a subject of most melancholy and
      momentous consultation. Mrs. Norris, whose attachment seemed to augment
      with the demerits of her niece, would have had her received at home and
      countenanced by them all. Sir Thomas would not hear of it; and Mrs.
      Norris&rsquo;s anger against Fanny was so much the greater, from considering <i>her</i>
      residence there as the motive. She persisted in placing his scruples to <i>her</i>
      account, though Sir Thomas very solemnly assured her that, had there been
      no young woman in question, had there been no young person of either sex
      belonging to him, to be endangered by the society or hurt by the character
      of Mrs. Rushworth, he would never have offered so great an insult to the
      neighbourhood as to expect it to notice her. As a daughter, he hoped a
      penitent one, she should be protected by him, and secured in every
      comfort, and supported by every encouragement to do right, which their
      relative situations admitted; but farther than <i>that</i> he could not
      go. Maria had destroyed her own character, and he would not, by a vain
      attempt to restore what never could be restored, by affording his sanction
      to vice, or in seeking to lessen its disgrace, be anywise accessory to
      introducing such misery in another man&rsquo;s family as he had known himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      It ended in Mrs. Norris&rsquo;s resolving to quit Mansfield and devote herself
      to her unfortunate Maria, and in an establishment being formed for them in
      another country, remote and private, where, shut up together with little
      society, on one side no affection, on the other no judgment, it may be
      reasonably supposed that their tempers became their mutual punishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Norris&rsquo;s removal from Mansfield was the great supplementary comfort
      of Sir Thomas&rsquo;s life. His opinion of her had been sinking from the day of
      his return from Antigua: in every transaction together from that period,
      in their daily intercourse, in business, or in chat, she had been
      regularly losing ground in his esteem, and convincing him that either time
      had done her much disservice, or that he had considerably over-rated her
      sense, and wonderfully borne with her manners before. He had felt her as
      an hourly evil, which was so much the worse, as there seemed no chance of
      its ceasing but with life; she seemed a part of himself that must be borne
      for ever. To be relieved from her, therefore, was so great a felicity
      that, had she not left bitter remembrances behind her, there might have
      been danger of his learning almost to approve the evil which produced such
      a good.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was regretted by no one at Mansfield. She had never been able to
      attach even those she loved best; and since Mrs. Rushworth&rsquo;s elopement,
      her temper had been in a state of such irritation as to make her
      everywhere tormenting. Not even Fanny had tears for aunt Norris, not even
      when she was gone for ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      That Julia escaped better than Maria was owing, in some measure, to a
      favourable difference of disposition and circumstance, but in a greater to
      her having been less the darling of that very aunt, less flattered and
      less spoilt. Her beauty and acquirements had held but a second place. She
      had been always used to think herself a little inferior to Maria. Her
      temper was naturally the easiest of the two; her feelings, though quick,
      were more controllable, and education had not given her so very hurtful a
      degree of self-consequence.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had submitted the best to the disappointment in Henry Crawford. After
      the first bitterness of the conviction of being slighted was over, she had
      been tolerably soon in a fair way of not thinking of him again; and when
      the acquaintance was renewed in town, and Mr. Rushworth&rsquo;s house became
      Crawford&rsquo;s object, she had had the merit of withdrawing herself from it,
      and of chusing that time to pay a visit to her other friends, in order to
      secure herself from being again too much attracted. This had been her
      motive in going to her cousin&rsquo;s. Mr. Yates&rsquo;s convenience had had nothing
      to do with it. She had been allowing his attentions some time, but with
      very little idea of ever accepting him; and had not her sister&rsquo;s conduct
      burst forth as it did, and her increased dread of her father and of home,
      on that event, imagining its certain consequence to herself would be
      greater severity and restraint, made her hastily resolve on avoiding such
      immediate horrors at all risks, it is probable that Mr. Yates would never
      have succeeded. She had not eloped with any worse feelings than those of
      selfish alarm. It had appeared to her the only thing to be done. Maria&rsquo;s
      guilt had induced Julia&rsquo;s folly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry Crawford, ruined by early independence and bad domestic example,
      indulged in the freaks of a cold-blooded vanity a little too long. Once it
      had, by an opening undesigned and unmerited, led him into the way of
      happiness. Could he have been satisfied with the conquest of one amiable
      woman&rsquo;s affections, could he have found sufficient exultation in
      overcoming the reluctance, in working himself into the esteem and
      tenderness of Fanny Price, there would have been every probability of
      success and felicity for him. His affection had already done something.
      Her influence over him had already given him some influence over her.
      Would he have deserved more, there can be no doubt that more would have
      been obtained, especially when that marriage had taken place, which would
      have given him the assistance of her conscience in subduing her first
      inclination, and brought them very often together. Would he have
      persevered, and uprightly, Fanny must have been his reward, and a reward
      very voluntarily bestowed, within a reasonable period from Edmund&rsquo;s
      marrying Mary.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had he done as he intended, and as he knew he ought, by going down to
      Everingham after his return from Portsmouth, he might have been deciding
      his own happy destiny. But he was pressed to stay for Mrs. Fraser&rsquo;s party;
      his staying was made of flattering consequence, and he was to meet Mrs.
      Rushworth there. Curiosity and vanity were both engaged, and the
      temptation of immediate pleasure was too strong for a mind unused to make
      any sacrifice to right: he resolved to defer his Norfolk journey, resolved
      that writing should answer the purpose of it, or that its purpose was
      unimportant, and staid. He saw Mrs. Rushworth, was received by her with a
      coldness which ought to have been repulsive, and have established apparent
      indifference between them for ever; but he was mortified, he could not
      bear to be thrown off by the woman whose smiles had been so wholly at his
      command: he must exert himself to subdue so proud a display of resentment;
      it was anger on Fanny&rsquo;s account; he must get the better of it, and make
      Mrs. Rushworth Maria Bertram again in her treatment of himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this spirit he began the attack, and by animated perseverance had soon
      re-established the sort of familiar intercourse, of gallantry, of
      flirtation, which bounded his views; but in triumphing over the discretion
      which, though beginning in anger, might have saved them both, he had put
      himself in the power of feelings on her side more strong than he had
      supposed. She loved him; there was no withdrawing attentions avowedly dear
      to her. He was entangled by his own vanity, with as little excuse of love
      as possible, and without the smallest inconstancy of mind towards her
      cousin. To keep Fanny and the Bertrams from a knowledge of what was
      passing became his first object. Secrecy could not have been more
      desirable for Mrs. Rushworth&rsquo;s credit than he felt it for his own. When he
      returned from Richmond, he would have been glad to see Mrs. Rushworth no
      more. All that followed was the result of her imprudence; and he went off
      with her at last, because he could not help it, regretting Fanny even at
      the moment, but regretting her infinitely more when all the bustle of the
      intrigue was over, and a very few months had taught him, by the force of
      contrast, to place a yet higher value on the sweetness of her temper, the
      purity of her mind, and the excellence of her principles.
    </p>
    <p>
      That punishment, the public punishment of disgrace, should in a just
      measure attend <i>his</i> share of the offence is, we know, not one of the
      barriers which society gives to virtue. In this world the penalty is less
      equal than could be wished; but without presuming to look forward to a
      juster appointment hereafter, we may fairly consider a man of sense, like
      Henry Crawford, to be providing for himself no small portion of vexation
      and regret: vexation that must rise sometimes to self-reproach, and regret
      to wretchedness, in having so requited hospitality, so injured family
      peace, so forfeited his best, most estimable, and endeared acquaintance,
      and so lost the woman whom he had rationally as well as passionately
      loved.
    </p>
    <p>
      After what had passed to wound and alienate the two families, the
      continuance of the Bertrams and Grants in such close neighbourhood would
      have been most distressing; but the absence of the latter, for some months
      purposely lengthened, ended very fortunately in the necessity, or at least
      the practicability, of a permanent removal. Dr. Grant, through an interest
      on which he had almost ceased to form hopes, succeeded to a stall in
      Westminster, which, as affording an occasion for leaving Mansfield, an
      excuse for residence in London, and an increase of income to answer the
      expenses of the change, was highly acceptable to those who went and those
      who staid.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Grant, with a temper to love and be loved, must have gone with some
      regret from the scenes and people she had been used to; but the same
      happiness of disposition must in any place, and any society, secure her a
      great deal to enjoy, and she had again a home to offer Mary; and Mary had
      had enough of her own friends, enough of vanity, ambition, love, and
      disappointment in the course of the last half-year, to be in need of the
      true kindness of her sister&rsquo;s heart, and the rational tranquillity of her
      ways. They lived together; and when Dr. Grant had brought on apoplexy and
      death, by three great institutionary dinners in one week, they still lived
      together; for Mary, though perfectly resolved against ever attaching
      herself to a younger brother again, was long in finding among the dashing
      representatives, or idle heir-apparents, who were at the command of her
      beauty, and her £20,000, any one who could satisfy the better taste she had
      acquired at Mansfield, whose character and manners could authorise a hope
      of the domestic happiness she had there learned to estimate, or put Edmund
      Bertram sufficiently out of her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Edmund had greatly the advantage of her in this respect. He had not to
      wait and wish with vacant affections for an object worthy to succeed her
      in them. Scarcely had he done regretting Mary Crawford, and observing to
      Fanny how impossible it was that he should ever meet with such another
      woman, before it began to strike him whether a very different kind of
      woman might not do just as well, or a great deal better: whether Fanny
      herself were not growing as dear, as important to him in all her smiles
      and all her ways, as Mary Crawford had ever been; and whether it might not
      be a possible, an hopeful undertaking to persuade her that her warm and
      sisterly regard for him would be foundation enough for wedded love.
    </p>
    <p>
      I purposely abstain from dates on this occasion, that every one may be at
      liberty to fix their own, aware that the cure of unconquerable passions,
      and the transfer of unchanging attachments, must vary much as to time in
      different people. I only entreat everybody to believe that exactly at the
      time when it was quite natural that it should be so, and not a week
      earlier, Edmund did cease to care about Miss Crawford, and became as
      anxious to marry Fanny as Fanny herself could desire.
    </p>
    <p>
      With such a regard for her, indeed, as his had long been, a regard founded
      on the most endearing claims of innocence and helplessness, and completed
      by every recommendation of growing worth, what could be more natural than
      the change? Loving, guiding, protecting her, as he had been doing ever
      since her being ten years old, her mind in so great a degree formed by his
      care, and her comfort depending on his kindness, an object to him of such
      close and peculiar interest, dearer by all his own importance with her
      than any one else at Mansfield, what was there now to add, but that he
      should learn to prefer soft light eyes to sparkling dark ones. And being
      always with her, and always talking confidentially, and his feelings
      exactly in that favourable state which a recent disappointment gives,
      those soft light eyes could not be very long in obtaining the
      pre-eminence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having once set out, and felt that he had done so on this road to
      happiness, there was nothing on the side of prudence to stop him or make
      his progress slow; no doubts of her deserving, no fears of opposition of
      taste, no need of drawing new hopes of happiness from dissimilarity of
      temper. Her mind, disposition, opinions, and habits wanted no
      half-concealment, no self-deception on the present, no reliance on future
      improvement. Even in the midst of his late infatuation, he had
      acknowledged Fanny&rsquo;s mental superiority. What must be his sense of it now,
      therefore? She was of course only too good for him; but as nobody minds
      having what is too good for them, he was very steadily earnest in the
      pursuit of the blessing, and it was not possible that encouragement from
      her should be long wanting. Timid, anxious, doubting as she was, it was
      still impossible that such tenderness as hers should not, at times, hold
      out the strongest hope of success, though it remained for a later period
      to tell him the whole delightful and astonishing truth. His happiness in
      knowing himself to have been so long the beloved of such a heart, must
      have been great enough to warrant any strength of language in which he
      could clothe it to her or to himself; it must have been a delightful
      happiness. But there was happiness elsewhere which no description can
      reach. Let no one presume to give the feelings of a young woman on
      receiving the assurance of that affection of which she has scarcely
      allowed herself to entertain a hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their own inclinations ascertained, there were no difficulties behind, no
      drawback of poverty or parent. It was a match which Sir Thomas&rsquo;s wishes
      had even forestalled. Sick of ambitious and mercenary connexions, prizing
      more and more the sterling good of principle and temper, and chiefly
      anxious to bind by the strongest securities all that remained to him of
      domestic felicity, he had pondered with genuine satisfaction on the more
      than possibility of the two young friends finding their natural
      consolation in each other for all that had occurred of disappointment to
      either; and the joyful consent which met Edmund&rsquo;s application, the high
      sense of having realised a great acquisition in the promise of Fanny for a
      daughter, formed just such a contrast with his early opinion on the
      subject when the poor little girl&rsquo;s coming had been first agitated, as
      time is for ever producing between the plans and decisions of mortals, for
      their own instruction, and their neighbours&rsquo; entertainment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fanny was indeed the daughter that he wanted. His charitable kindness had
      been rearing a prime comfort for himself. His liberality had a rich
      repayment, and the general goodness of his intentions by her deserved it.
      He might have made her childhood happier; but it had been an error of
      judgment only which had given him the appearance of harshness, and
      deprived him of her early love; and now, on really knowing each other,
      their mutual attachment became very strong. After settling her at Thornton
      Lacey with every kind attention to her comfort, the object of almost every
      day was to see her there, or to get her away from it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Selfishly dear as she had long been to Lady Bertram, she could not be
      parted with willingly by <i>her</i>. No happiness of son or niece could
      make her wish the marriage. But it was possible to part with her, because
      Susan remained to supply her place. Susan became the stationary niece,
      delighted to be so; and equally well adapted for it by a readiness of
      mind, and an inclination for usefulness, as Fanny had been by sweetness of
      temper, and strong feelings of gratitude. Susan could never be spared.
      First as a comfort to Fanny, then as an auxiliary, and last as her
      substitute, she was established at Mansfield, with every appearance of
      equal permanency. Her more fearless disposition and happier nerves made
      everything easy to her there. With quickness in understanding the tempers
      of those she had to deal with, and no natural timidity to restrain any
      consequent wishes, she was soon welcome and useful to all; and after
      Fanny&rsquo;s removal succeeded so naturally to her influence over the hourly
      comfort of her aunt, as gradually to become, perhaps, the most beloved of
      the two. In <i>her</i> usefulness, in Fanny&rsquo;s excellence, in William&rsquo;s
      continued good conduct and rising fame, and in the general well-doing and
      success of the other members of the family, all assisting to advance each
      other, and doing credit to his countenance and aid, Sir Thomas saw
      repeated, and for ever repeated, reason to rejoice in what he had done for
      them all, and acknowledge the advantages of early hardship and discipline,
      and the consciousness of being born to struggle and endure.
    </p>
    <p>
      With so much true merit and true love, and no want of fortune and friends,
      the happiness of the married cousins must appear as secure as earthly
      happiness can be. Equally formed for domestic life, and attached to
      country pleasures, their home was the home of affection and comfort; and
      to complete the picture of good, the acquisition of Mansfield living, by
      the death of Dr. Grant, occurred just after they had been married long
      enough to begin to want an increase of income, and feel their distance
      from the paternal abode an inconvenience.
    </p>
    <p>
      On that event they removed to Mansfield; and the Parsonage there, which,
      under each of its two former owners, Fanny had never been able to approach
      but with some painful sensation of restraint or alarm, soon grew as dear
      to her heart, and as thoroughly perfect in her eyes, as everything else
      within the view and patronage of Mansfield Park had long been.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &ldquo;Right
of Replacement or Refund&rdquo; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a

is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
